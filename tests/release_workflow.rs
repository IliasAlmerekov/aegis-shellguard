//! Red tests for M3.2 — static musl release targets.
//!
//! These tests encode the release-workflow target matrix contract. The current
//! `.github/workflows/release.yml` uses GNU targets and has no static-binary
//! verification step, so the migration tests are expected to FAIL until the
//! workflow is migrated to musl targets. The asset-name test is a preservation
//! invariant (already green) and must stay green across the migration.
