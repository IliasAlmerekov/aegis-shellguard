## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `DK-007` pattern for `docker volume rm` (Danger), deliberately breaking
  parity with the other DK-* rules (all Warn): it destroys the named volume
  the user pointed at, usually the only copy of a database's data (M5.5 #192).

- New `PatternToken::ShortFlag { short, long }` prefix-pattern token that
  matches one short flag whether it stands alone or is bundled into a cluster
  (`-R`, `-Rf`, `-fR`) together with its declared long-form synonyms
  (`--recursive`). Flags compare case-sensitively, so `-r` does not satisfy
  `short: 'R'`. The prefix matcher handles it explicitly with no catch-all arm,
  so a future token variant is a compile error. No rule adopts it yet; the
  `chmod` rule that follows consumes it. (M5.1, #189)

- New `DB-009` `Danger` rule detects destructive SQL `TRUNCATE` written without
  the `TABLE` keyword, closing the gap where the shorter MySQL/PostgreSQL
  spelling passed as `Safe` (`DB-004` only covered `truncate table`). It is a
  match-anywhere regex `Pattern` (ADR-015), so it is delivery-agnostic across
  `-c`/`-e`/`--command`/`--execute`/heredoc/stdin/`;`-compound. It fires only on
  forms carrying a SQL-only anchor — the `ONLY` keyword, a `CASCADE`/`RESTRICT`
  referential action, a `RESTART`/`CONTINUE IDENTITY` clause, or a comma list
  before one of those — so the coreutils `truncate` command (FS-006) and
  ordinary prose stay clear. Bare `TRUNCATE <ident>` and a bare comma list are
  declared uncovered forms. (M5.4, #191)

### Changed

- Prefix rules whose first token is not `Single`/`Alts` (a wildcard or a flag)
  are now rejected at load time instead of being silently dropped from the
  program index and never firing at runtime. (M5.1, #189)

- Distribution: regenerated the Homebrew formula pins and the npm checksum
  pins from the published v0.6.4 Release assets. Publication to the Homebrew
  tap and the `brew audit`/install smoke remain open operator steps.

## [0.6.4] — 2026-08-17

### Security

- A contained panic at the `Hook` boundary now fails closed: an unwind anywhere
  across the `Hook` entry point is converted into the ordinary deny response
  with one fixed, detail-free reason, and the installed per-agent `Hook` scripts
  stop `exec`-ing the binary so they survive its death and deny on a non-zero
  exit status. The agent never mistakes a crash for permission to run the
  command. Existing installations must re-run `aegis install-hooks` to refresh
  the scripts. (M4, ADR-023)

- Reject non-ASCII Bash source before it reaches the pinned `tree-sitter-bash`
  native scanner, which AddressSanitizer proved could segfault; the fail-closed
  result is preserved as typed `UnsupportedEncoding` degradation and the worker
  protocol is bumped to v2. (ADR-022)

### Added

- Claude Code and Codex sessions now report Aegis' effective enforcement state
  when they start, so a disabled Toggle can no longer stay invisible across
  sessions. The notice travels inside each agent's `SessionStart` envelope as
  `additionalContext`, names unguarded passthrough when the Toggle is off, and
  reports enforcement when CI overrides it. Informational only — session starts
  produce no audit entry; Toggle transitions remain the auditable action.
  Existing installations receive the managed hooks on an explicit
  `aegis install-hooks` rerun; hooks never self-update at session runtime.
  (M3a, ADR-005, ADR-006, ADR-007)

- The session-start notice is pinned to `aegis status`, the authoritative
  surface for effective state: a contract test derives the state from both and
  requires agreement across six environments, including a falsy `AEGIS_CI`
  override and a non-empty `JENKINS_URL`. The hooks resolve the Toggle inline in
  shell (ADR-007), so nothing else kept the two from drifting apart. (M3a)

- Landing: a real-time WebGL hero — a fractured stone cube, pinned 200vh and
  scrubbed by scroll through a camera approach, the fracture opening, a Policy
  Lock and a handoff to black. Built on react-three-fiber (`three`,
  `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/postprocessing`)
  under `src/components/hero/`, with every number in `src/lib/scene/config.ts`.
  The geometry is generated rather than authored: a displacement field
  evaluated in pre-cut coordinates, so neighbouring quarters mate jag for jag
  by construction. Scroll reaches the scene as one number passed through a
  density map, so the copy, the camera and the stone cannot drift out of phase.
  Replaces the frame-sequence hero (see Removed).

- Landing: a one-way quality ladder driven by measured frame time
  (`src/lib/scene/ladder.ts`) — median rather than mean, warm-up before it
  judges, and every stretch bounded in both frames and milliseconds so a weak
  machine is not the one that waits longest for its own downgrade. Tiers can be
  pinned with `?tier=`, and scene time frozen with `?freeze=`, so captures are
  reproducible.

- Landing: a Vitest suite (66 tests) over the parts of the scene that are pure
  arithmetic — the fracture geometry, the density map and phase spans, the
  hover approach, the quality ladder. `npm test` in `landing/`.

- Landing: `scripts/rock-to-webp.mjs` and `scripts/textures.mjs` build the
  stone maps and the phone-sized normal map from the CC0 sources recorded in
  `public/textures/CREDITS.md`, so the texture pipeline is reproducible from
  the repository rather than from a working directory.

### Changed

- Distribution: regenerated npm checksum pins and the Homebrew formula from the
  published v0.6.3 Release; published the matching formula to the Homebrew tap
  while retaining the L1 gate pending platform smoke evidence. (ADR-022)

- Landing: phones get a 512² normal map (158 KB) instead of the 1024² desktop
  one (653 KB), built by `scripts/textures.mjs` and selected by the same media
  query in both the preload and the loader. Total transfer on a phone: 2.04 MB
  → 0.85 MB.

- Landing: render the hero shot at a fractional position rather than at the
  nearest frame index, compositing the two frames a position falls between at
  the fractional weight. A slow scroll now moves the hand continuously instead
  of stepping one frame at a time, and frames still downloading widen the
  blended pair so gaps play as a dissolve rather than a step.

- Landing: cap the hero canvas backing store at 2.7 megapixels and bound the
  scrubbed timeline's per-frame work — no animated filters, `power2.out` instead
  of `expo.out` on scrubbed arrivals, and `ignoreMobileResize` so a collapsing
  URL bar no longer refreshes the pin mid-scroll. Pin length 100vh → 140vh.

- Landing: recast the "Built to be trusted" evidence grid as a bento layout —
  four columns with two double-width cells, each cell a single link carrying a
  large Lucide mark, the file that settles the claim, and a bottom-anchored
  name with one line of note.

- Landing: reshape the closing Get started/footer into a taped, slightly
  skewed panel without navigation, retaining the Aegis description, actions,
  and steel/oxide palette.

- Landing: recast the sourced AI-agent incident reports as a responsive
  discussion-thread carousel with swipe and keyboard navigation, explicit
  pause/resume, reduced-motion behavior, and the Aegis steel/oxide palette.

### Fixed

- CI: retain `scripts/install.sh` compatibility with pre-v0.6.3 releases that
  do not carry `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, while keeping the notice fail-closed
  for v0.6.3 and later.

- `aegis install-hooks`/`uninstall` fully own Aegis' hook registrations: one
  shared prune (every matcher, both hook kinds, both agents) drops any
  Aegis-managed command that is not the canonical `(matcher, command)` entry;
  `uninstall` also removes the Claude session-start payload and registration it
  previously left behind. (#175)

- `aegis install-hooks` no longer aborts an agent's install because another
  tool's `SessionStart` or `PreToolUse` entry omits `matcher`. Both agents treat
  the field as optional, so a third-party hook could stop Aegis registering
  anything for that agent, which left its sessions with no notice and no
  interception. Each agent installs independently, so with `--all` the other
  agent was unaffected. Entries Aegis does not recognize are now skipped rather
  than rejected — in the Claude installer this covers the `PreToolUse` pass too,
  which runs first and so used to take the notice down with it. A `Bash`-matched
  entry with a malformed body still fails closed: that one is in the namespace
  Aegis prunes. (M3a)

- `aegis install-hooks` now repairs its own registration when it sits under a
  matcher Aegis never installs — a registration the agent never fires. Presence
  requires the command *and* the matcher, so a rerun adds a correctly-matched
  entry instead of reporting success over a dead one. (M3a)

- Landing: render every quality tier through the same post-processing chain.
  ACES tone mapping lives only in the composer and the renderer is
  deliberately `NoToneMapping`, but the lowest tier dropped the composer
  altogether — shipping an untone-mapped, visibly brighter frame with blown
  highlights to exactly the weakest machine. That tier now drops Bloom, which
  is the expensive pass, and keeps the chain.

- Landing: keep the mobile burger reachable from the first frame. The nav read
  its breakpoint once at mount, so the desktop hand-off (which hides the burger
  behind inline `visibility: hidden` until the header condenses) stayed applied
  after the viewport narrowed — rotating a device or resizing the window left a
  mobile layout with no way into the menu until a scroll revealed it. The
  hand-off now runs inside `gsap.matchMedia`, which reverts its own styles and
  ScrollTriggers as soon as the viewport crosses back below 768px.

- Landing: stop downloading every scene texture twice. The head preloads them
  as images without `crossOrigin`, while Three's ImageLoader requests them as
  `anonymous` — a different CORS mode, so the browser refused the warm entry
  and fetched each map a second time. A phone paid 1.6 MB for 805 KB of
  distinct bytes.

- Landing: text tokens that could not be read as text. `held` in the gate demo
  and in the three-step terminal used `--color-electric` (2.6:1) at 11px, and
  the evidence plate numbers used `--color-night-rim` (1.86:1), a border
  token — both surfaces documented a legibility requirement in their own
  comments and then missed it. Adds `--color-electric-text`, the text-weight
  step of Electric Blue, and moves the plate numbers to `cloud-faint`
  (WCAG 2.2 AA, 1.4.3).

- Landing: targets below the 24px floor of WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 — the install
  snippet's copy button (21×21), the incident captions' "View post" links
  (17px tall) and the desktop nav links (20px tall). None of the visible boxes
  changed; the targets grew by an invisible pad or by padding a taller row
  absorbs.

- Landing: `?freeze=` with an empty value froze the hero scene at second zero
  instead of being ignored — `Number('')` is 0, and 0 is a valid freeze point.

- Landing: play the hero frame sequence as the single continuous gesture it
  actually is. The 161-frame render was treated as a closed loop and mirrored by
  travel direction, but frame 161 is not frame 1 — the set is one reach
  (1–113), a fast recoil (114–119), and the start of a second reach. The hero
  now scrubs frames 1–119 strictly forward, with the recoil placed at the end of
  the pin, so the hand reaches through the scroll and is pulled back only at the
  close instead of lurching downward mid-scroll.

### Removed

- Landing: the frame-sequence hero. `public/frames` and `public/frames-sm`
  (8.7 MB) and `src/components/ui/FrameSequence.jsx` were unreferenced after
  the WebGL scene replaced them; the static export drops from 13 MB to 3.8 MB.

- Landing: `PLAN.md`, the pre-code brief for the hero. A brief goes stale the
  moment the code disagrees with it, and keeping it alongside `DESIGN.md`
  invited a reader to trust the wrong one. Everything worth keeping from it now
  lives in `DESIGN.md` as an account of what the code does.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Rebaselined the `heredoc_worst_case` performance policy row from 300 µs to
  1 ms. The first CI run that actually enforced the gate reported +193.3%; a
  bisect over `d12e971..8efd524` shows the slowdown accumulated across the
  shell-security commits (largest step: launcher-prefix normalization, ADR-014,
  which made the inline body a second regex scan target) and is unrelated to the
  language-aware series — `Scanner::assess` never enters `aegis-language`. Growth
  is linear (~118 µs/KB) and bounded by `MAX_INLINE_SCRIPT_LEN`. The redundant
  second scan is tracked as P3-9; evidence is in `docs/performance-baseline.md`.

### Fixed

- CI: the `Evaluate benchmark policy` step piped `aegis_benchcheck` into `tee`
  under Actions' implicit `bash -e` shell, which has no `pipefail`, so a failing
  benchmark policy exited 0 and the `Performance baseline (scanner bench)` gate
  reported success. The step now declares `shell: bash` with `set -euo pipefail`,
  and a contract test pins both.

### Added

- L1 Iteration 10: added a per-adapter qualification record and install-script
  delivery of the Tree-sitter provenance notice; Language-aware `MatchResult`
  debug output now applies the source-safe public projection (ADR-022 §8, §10,
  §11).

- L1 Iteration 10 Slice 3: recorded and contract-tested the local no-source,
  per-grammar, worker lifecycle/RSS, aggregate-timeout, and native-size
  qualification evidence without marking the four foundation adapters enabled
  or release-qualified (ADR-022 §2, §8, §9, §11).

- L1 Iteration 10 Slice 2: qualification regressions now pin source-free
  Language-aware Assessments across interactive TUI, audit, Watch NDJSON, and
  CI output; crash/timeout/malformed-worker degradation through fail-closed CI
  policy; and equivalent Assessment+Decision outcomes across Shell, Watch,
  Claude/Codex hooks, and CI (ADR-022 §5, §10, §11).

- L1 Iteration 10 (partial): ship Tree-sitter third-party notices with both the
  GitHub Release assets and the npm package, publish release assets fail-closed,
  and gate no-source plus per-grammar parse-latency regressions in the
  performance policy (ADR-022 §8, §11). The notice carries the Unicode license
  for the ICU subset the Tree-sitter runtime vendors, which the crate's declared
  `MIT` alone does not cover. It is scoped to the Tree-sitter
  components admitted by ADR-022 §8; it is not yet a distribution-complete
  attribution set, and Homebrew plus `scripts/install.sh` still install the
  binary only. Both gaps are recorded in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

- L1 Iteration 10 (partial): preserve dynamic-cwd direct-exec degradation,
  enforce exact grammar manifest metadata, build the shipping binary across the
  four-target release matrix, and add protocol/routing/per-adapter fuzz
  contracts (ADR-022 §6, §8, §11).

- L1: bounded command-working-directory tracking for Language-aware analysis
  (ADR-022 §6). Relative script-file and direct-exec sources now resolve against
  the intercepting command's working directory instead of the Aegis process
  directory, via `AnalysisCwd` and `RuntimeContext::assess_with_language_analysis_in_cwd`;
  Shell and Watch map an unresolved working directory to honest `Dynamic source`
  degradation rather than assuming `.`. Absolute paths and inline sources are
  unaffected.

- L1 Iteration 9: wired Language-aware assessment into Shell, Watch, hooks,
  JSON, and CI policy before allow auto-approval; added non-persistable Protect
  Analysis confirmation and Strict Analysis override flows, privacy-safe
  decisive evidence/degradation rendering, full routed-source resolution,
  bounded configurable session budgets, original-byte provenance, and
  end-to-end policy/config/runtime regressions (ADR-022 §5–§7).

- L1 Iteration 8: added the Bash adapter characterization corpus (ADR-022 §3,
  §7; plan Iteration 8), covering destructive shell operations, redirects,
  permissions, literal-bound and dynamic operands, substitutions, `source`,
  cross-language payloads, false positives, modern syntax, quoted/expanding
  heredocs, and malformed input.

- L1 Iteration 7: TypeScript corpus (ADR-022 §11, plan Iteration 7 RED — the
  corpus half). New `crates/aegis-language/tests/corpora/typescript/` (9 `.ts`
  files) + `tests/typescript_corpus.rs` harness (9 tests), mirroring the
  JavaScript corpus. Files embed compile-time via `include_str!` with a
  hand-derived `ExpectedOp` manifest (operation kinds, modifiers,
  `OperandCertainty`, parse-error count, nested payload `(language, source)`)
  independent of the adapter — a characterization + regression corpus pinning
  existing correct behavior, not a classic RED→GREEN. Coverage: `fs_delete`
  (unlinkSync/rmdirSync + rmSync recursive, incl. a `fs.unlinkSync<void>(…)`
  type-argument call), `fs_overwrite` (writeFileSync destructive_mode vs
  appendFileSync), `perms` (chmodSync/chownSync), `exec_shell`
  (child_process.exec/execSync/exec\<void\> → Bash nested payloads), `exec_js`
  (eval + new Function\<string\> → JavaScript nested payloads — the shared
  family module tags `eval`/`Function` as JS regardless of the enclosing file),
  `negatives` (comment/string/member-ref-without-call/unrelated-call/ESM
  import + TS-only `import type`/interface/type alias/enum/`as const`/
  `satisfies`/decorator → 0 ops), `dynamic_operand` (variable/cmd/template
  interpolation/`as`-cast operand → Dynamic certainty, NO nested payload),
  `modern_syntax` (generics, arrow generics `<T,>`, optional chaining,
  nullish coalescing, `as const`, `satisfies`, decorators, `import type`,
  mapped/conditional/`infer` types → parse clean, 0 ops), `malformed`
  (unterminated call → parse_errors > 0). The `modern_syntax` RED-risk is
  GREEN: pinned tree-sitter-typescript 0.23.2 parses current TypeScript
  file-scale with no false operations. No real-subprocess orchestration corpus
  this slice — the router routes no inline runner to TypeScript today (deferred
  with the TypeScript runner-routing slice).

### Changed

- L1: Watch and Shell now deny a policy-required confirmation when no TTY is
  available instead of auto-approving it, so a Language-aware degradation cannot be
  waived by the absence of an interactive terminal.

- L1: documented the accepted degradation gap where a relative direct-exec target
  under a dynamic working directory is dropped during routing instead of degrading,
  while the script-file shape degrades (ADR-022 §6). Scheduled for closure in the
  Iteration 10 qualification gate, which needs a degradation carrier that does not
  presuppose a resolved language.

- CI: the fuzz job runs on a pinned nightly toolchain (`FUZZ_NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN`)
  after a floating nightly hit an upstream codegen ICE building tokio under
  ASan/sancov, and the quality job installs `zsh`, which the recovery-degradation
  integration tests require as an effect-opaque interpreter now that `sh` is a
  routed interpreter.

- L1 Iteration 7: extracted the shared corpus-test harness into
  `crates/aegis-language/tests/common/corpus_harness.rs`. `ExpectedOp`,
  `assert_ops`, `assert_clean_no_ops`, `assert_malformed`, and `bash_exec` were
  duplicated verbatim across the JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python corpus
  harnesses; they now live in one `tests/common/` module included via `#[path]`
  (matching the `no_source_corpus.rs` precedent), so the three corpora stay in
  lockstep on assertion semantics. Language-specific payload builders
  (`js_exec`, `python_exec`) stay local to their corpus. Behavior-preserving —
  no test expectations changed.

- L1 Iteration 7 Slice 2: TypeScript worker wiring (ADR-022 §2, plan Iteration
  7 — the JavaScript-family Slice 1 → Slice 2 cadence's other half). The
  ephemeral worker now dispatches `Request::Analyze` for `TypeScript` to
  `aegis_language::languages::typescript::analyze`; `worker::analyze_source`
  routes `Python | JavaScript | TypeScript` to their adapters and leaves `Bash`
  as the sole `Response::UnsupportedLanguage` arm (L1 Shell/Bash is Iteration 8).
  The generic `map_operation` (Iteration 5) maps TS `DetectedOperation`s to
  `LANG-*` Matches for free, so no classifier change. New worker dispatch unit
  test `run_analyzes_typescript_source_and_returns_an_analyzed_response`
  (`fs.unlinkSync<void>("data.txt")` — TS-only type-argument syntax) RED→GREEN;
  the existing `run_returns_unsupported_language_for_a_language_without_an_adapter`
  retargeted TypeScript → Bash to preserve the UnsupportedLanguage → degradation
  contract TS no longer exercises. No orchestration/subprocess test this slice:
  the router routes no inline runner to TypeScript today, so an end-to-end TS
  fixture would be synthetic (deferred with the TypeScript runner-routing slice).

- L1 Iteration 7 Slice 1: TypeScript adapter (ADR-022 §3, plan Iteration 7 —
  the JavaScript-family's other half). New
  `aegis_language::languages::typescript::analyze` parses TypeScript with the
  pinned tree-sitter-typescript 0.23.2 grammar and a new
  `queries/typescript/calls.scm` query, then interprets call sites through the
  shared JavaScript-family logic. The grammar-agnostic interpretation
  (API-spelling → Detected operation, operand certainty, recursive-option
  resolution, nested payload recovery, the call-capture query loop) was
  extracted into a shared `aegis_language::languages::family` module that both
  the JavaScript and TypeScript adapters call (plan Iteration 7: "share
  JavaScript-family resolution where syntax permits, but keep grammar and span
  handling explicit per adapter"); the JS adapter's existing unit tests + corpus
  guard the behavior-preserving extraction. 31 TS unit tests cover one tracer
  per operation category plus TypeScript-only syntax: calls with explicit type
  arguments (`fs.unlinkSync<void>("x")`, `eval<string>(...)`,
  `new Function<string>(...)` — all three `calls.scm` query patterns stay bound
  because `type_arguments` is a separate child, not the `function`/`constructor`
  field), destructive calls inside generic class methods, typed variable
  operands, and interfaces / enums / type aliases
  / `import type` / `as` / `satisfies` / decorators as negatives, plus a
  modern-TS parse-clean case. The pinned grammar parses current TypeScript
  (incl. `satisfies`, decorators, generics) cleanly with no false operations.
  NOT yet wired into the worker: `analyze_source` still routes TypeScript →
  `UnsupportedLanguage` (Slice 2 follow-up, mirroring JS); TS corpora, Node
  file/stdin + TS runner-routing negatives, per-adapter fuzz target, and the
  all-four-targets qualification gate remain deferred.
- L1 Iteration 7: JavaScript adapter corpus + Node inline `-e` full-pipeline
  fixtures (ADR-022 §11, plan Iteration 7 RED). Checked-in
  positive/negative/narrowness/modern-syntax/malformed `.js` corpus under
  `crates/aegis-language/tests/corpora/javascript/` driven by a data-driven
  `tests/javascript_corpus.rs` harness over the public `javascript::analyze`
  seam; expectations are hand-derived from ADR-022 §3/§7 + JavaScript API
  semantics (independent of the adapter, so a real regression fails).
  `modern_syntax` proves the pinned tree-sitter-javascript 0.25.0 grammar
  parses optional chaining, nullish coalescing, logical assignment, class
  fields/private methods/getters, async/await, template literals, destructuring,
  spread, exponentiation, numeric separators, BigInt, and optional catch binding
  cleanly with no false operations; `malformed` proves a nonzero parse-error count
  is reported. Three real-worker `node -e` fixtures added to
  `tests/analysis_orchestrate.rs` covering `fs.chmodSync` (`LANG-FS-CHMOD`),
  `fs.writeFileSync` (`LANG-FS-OVR-W`), and `eval('fs.unlinkSync(x)')` whose
  recursive JavaScript target is analyzed (not degraded) — pinning the JS→JS
  recursion contract the prior JS exec test (Bash payload, degrades as
  `GrammarUnavailable`) did not cover. Deferred: `fs.promises.*`/callback-form
  variants, import/alias/constant → `Partial`-certainty corpus (bounded
  resolution), `DatabaseDestructive` corpus (adapter does not emit it), chained
  member calls (`a.b.c()` — `calls.scm` matches `object: (identifier)` only),
  Node file/stdin and TypeScript runner-routing negative cases, adapter fuzz
  target, TypeScript adapter.
- L1 Iteration 7 Slice 2: JavaScript adapter runs in the self-spawned worker
  (ADR-022 §2, plan Iteration 7). `aegis-language::worker::analyze_source` now
  routes `SourceLanguage::JavaScript` → `javascript::analyze`, so `node -e`
  inline bodies flow end-to-end through route → worker → mapping → merge.
  TypeScript and Bash remain `UnsupportedLanguage` (later iterations). The
  generic shared classifier maps JS `DetectedOperation`s to `LANG-*` Matches
  unchanged. Still NOT wired into `RuntimeContext::assess`; JS corpora, TS
  adapter, fs.promises/callback forms, chained member calls, and the
  all-four-targets qualification gate remain deferred.
- L1 Iteration 6 Slice C: recursive drain closes the Iteration 6 core
  (ADR-022 §2/§7). `aegis::analysis::run` now drains the parent-owned
  `AnalysisQueue`: inline targets seed the queue at depth 0; the drain loop pops
  a target, spawns a fresh worker, sends one `Request::Analyze`, maps the
  `Response` through `map_adapter_result` with the target's own `depth` and
  `source_hash`, and pushes any literal execution-sink `recursive_targets` back
  onto the queue until it empties or a budget cap fires (`LimitExceeded`
  degradation recorded, ADR-022 §7). A literal `exec`/`eval` payload's nested
  destructive op now surfaces in the merged `Assessment` alongside the top-level
  sink match. `run`'s signature is unchanged; `map_target_result` is refactored
  to `(LanguageAnalysisResult, Vec<QueueTarget>)` and `target_count` covers
  top-level + recursive targets. Still NOT wired into `RuntimeContext::assess`;
  `ScriptFile`/`DirectExec` fs reads, live-assess integration, `aegis-config`
  budget/alias wiring, and worker reuse across pops remain deferred.
- L1 Iteration 6: Python adapter corpus + inline `-c` full-pipeline fixtures
  (ADR-022 §11, plan Iteration 6 RED). Checked-in positive/negative/narrowness/
  modern-syntax/malformed `.py` corpus under
  `crates/aegis-language/tests/corpora/python/` driven by a data-driven
  `tests/python_corpus.rs` harness over the public `python::analyze` seam;
  expectations are hand-derived from ADR-022 §3/§7 + Python API semantics
  (independent of the adapter, so a real regression fails). `modern_syntax`
  proves the pinned tree-sitter-python 0.25.0 grammar parses `match`/walrus/
  `except*`/f-string-debug cleanly with no false operations; `malformed` proves
  a nonzero parse-error count is reported. Three real-worker inline `-c`
  fixtures added to `tests/analysis_orchestrate.rs` covering `os.chmod`
  (`LANG-FS-CHMOD`), `open('w')` (`LANG-FS-OVR-W`), and cross-language
  `os.system("rm …")` whose recursive Bash target degrades as `GrammarUnavailable`
  (L1 Bash is Iteration 8; ADR-022 §9 honest degradation). Deferred: import/alias/
  constant → `Partial`-certainty corpus (bounded resolution), `DatabaseDestructive`
  corpus (adapter does not emit it), stdin/heredoc-to-file/named-file fixtures
  (need `ScriptFile` fs-read wiring in `run`), adapter fuzz target.

- L1 Iteration 6 Slice B: parent-side language-analysis orchestration
  (ADR-022 §2/§6). New `aegis::analysis::run` routes a command's inline source
  targets, spawns the ephemeral worker, sends one `Request::Analyze` per inline
  target, maps each `Response` via the existing in-process `map_adapter_result`,
  and folds the per-target `LanguageAnalysisResult`s into the baseline
  `Assessment` through a single aggregated `merge_analysis`. Returns
  `Outcome::NotStarted { baseline }` (no subprocess spawned, ADR-022 §0) when
  `route` yields no analyzable inline target, else
  `Outcome::Analyzed { assessment, target_count }`. `worker_client::TargetRequest`
  gained a `kind: RequestKind { Parse, Analyze }` field so the transport carries
  `Request::Analyze` without breaking the Iteration-3 `Parse` tests.
  `Assessment` is now `Debug`+`Clone`. This is the isolated tracer bullet proving
  the parent ↔ worker ↔ adapter ↔ mapping ↔ merge composition with a real
  subprocess; it is NOT yet wired into `RuntimeContext::assess`, and recursive
  drain / `ScriptFile`/`DirectExec` fs reads / `source_hash` remain deferred.

- L1 Iteration 6 Slice A: the ephemeral language worker now runs the language
  adapter and returns a full `AdapterResult`, satisfying ADR-022 §2
  ("Tree-sitter parsing and language adapters run in a self-spawned, ephemeral
  worker process"). The worker protocol gained `Request::Analyze` /
  `Response::Analyzed { result }` / `Response::UnsupportedLanguage` (kind tags
  `0x02` / `0x83` / `0x84`; `Parse`/`Parsed`/`ParseFailed` retained). An
  `Analyze` request for Python dispatches to `python::analyze` and frames the
  result as `Analyzed`; the other foundation grammars (no adapter yet) return
  `UnsupportedLanguage`; invalid-UTF-8 source returns `Analyzed` with one parse
  error and no operations (the adapter takes a `&str`; the parent owns the
  encoding contract, ADR-022 §7). The `Analyzed` payload is the hand-rolled
  packed little-endian `AdapterResult` codec, framed as-is by the versioned
  pipe protocol.

- L1 Iteration 6 (slices 1-2): first production-qualified language adapter
  (Python) and the root mapping that composes its output through the shared
  classifier and cross-language execution-sink invariant — ADR-022 §2/§3/§7.
  `aegis_language::languages::python::analyze` runs a `calls.scm` Tree-sitter
  query and interprets each call site in typed Rust, emitting the
  boundary-forced parallel operation vocabulary (`aegis_language::operation` —
  `aegis-language` may not depend on `aegis-types`, ADR-022 §4) covering
  filesystem delete/overwrite, permission/ownership changes, `eval`/`exec`,
  `os.system`/`subprocess.*` execution sinks with cross-language literal
  payloads, and dynamic operands (variable / list argv / f-string → no payload).
  `aegis::analysis::mapping::{map_operation, map_adapter_result}` converts the
  parallel vocabulary into `aegis_types::DetectedOperation` one-for-one and
  composes a `MappingOutcome` (`LanguageAnalysisResult` + recursive
  `QueueTarget`s): a `CodeExecution` sink with a literal payload enqueues a
  bounded recursive target at `parent_depth + 1` (the payload's own language);
  a dynamic/encoded payload records `DynamicSource` and enqueues nothing; a
  nonzero `parse_errors` count records `IncompleteSyntax`; status aggregates
  monotonically. Pinned by `tests/language_python_pipeline.rs` (9 tests,
  in-process — no worker subprocess). Worker/`merge_analysis` runtime wiring,
  bounded symbol resolution, and the full qualification gate remain deferred.

### Fixed

- L1 Iteration 6 review pass: the root mapping no longer records
  `DegradationReason::DynamicSource` for a *non-execution* op whose operand is
  dynamic (e.g. `os.remove(path)`). `DynamicSource` is "source or working
  directory was dynamic" (ADR-022 §4); ADR-022 mandates degradation only for
  dynamic execution-sink payloads (§3/§7) or dynamic source/cwd (§6), not for a
  non-execution dynamic operand — the shared classifier already assigns the
  correct risk certainty-independently. Pinned by
  `non_exec_dynamic_operand_emits_match_without_degradation`. Also moved the
  Python adapter's `Parser::set_language` out of the per-`analyze()` call into
  a one-time `thread_local` init (`.expect()` now lives in startup init, not on
  a per-invocation production path — CONVENTION.md §5), and brought the
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 `analysis` bullet into sync with the current
  `src/analysis/` surface (worker client, routing, queue/sink invariant, mapping).

- L1 Iteration 5: shared language-aware operation classifier
  (`aegis_types::classify` / `language_match`), parent-owned recursive
  analysis work queue (`aegis::analysis::queue`), and the cross-language
  execution-sink invariant (`aegis::analysis::recursive::handle_sink`) —
  ADR-022 §3/§7. The classifier maps a `DetectedOperation` to
  `Category`/`RiskLevel`/`Match` (never `Block`; risk is certainty-independent
  so a `Dynamic` operand never lowers it), the queue dedups targets by
  `(language, source_hash)` with depth (8) / count / aggregate-byte (1 MiB) /
  deadline caps, and a recognized process/shell/eval sink always emits a
  `CodeExecution` Match plus a bounded recursive target (literal payload) or
  `DynamicSource` degradation (dynamic/encoded payload, never evaluated or
  decoded). The classifier lives in `aegis-types` (the plan's
  `aegis-language/src/classifier.rs` would violate the ADR-022 §4 leaf-crate
  boundary — same correction as Iteration 4's `router.rs`). No production
  wiring yet; bounded symbol resolution and adapter result merging land with
  the Iterations 6-8 adapters.

### Fixed

- Made `concurrent_symlink_swap_race_never_panics_or_corrupts_content`
  (`source_reader.rs`) tolerant of contended CI runners: widened the race
  window and retried up to 5 rounds before failing on zero observed
  successful reads, instead of asserting on a single 300ms attempt.

- Language-worker protocol/client hardening (ADR-022 §2, L1 Iteration 3
  re-review): the encoder is now fallible (`encode_request`/`encode_response`
  return `Result<Vec<u8>, EncodeError>`) so an oversized source is rejected as
  `EncodeError::Oversized` instead of `.expect()`-panicking (no `.expect()` in
  production); the 1 MiB source ceiling is now legal — `MAX_SOURCE_BYTES = 1
  MiB` and `MAX_FRAME_PAYLOAD = MAX_SOURCE_BYTES + 1` budget the 1-byte language
  tag, so a 1 MiB source round-trips instead of being rejected as oversized
  (off-by-one fixed); the parent client propagates the stdin `flush()` error
  instead of dropping it (`let _ = flush` → typed `WorkerError::Io`), so a flush
  failure no longer masquerades as a read `Timeout`; `Worker::analyze` closes
  stdin after sending and reaps the child, and a worker that responds fully then
  exits non-zero degrades the whole session as `WorkerError::NonZeroExit`
  (previously silently reported as success); the `--internal-language-worker`
  flag literal is now a single shared `aegis::analysis::INTERNAL_LANGUAGE_WORKER
  _FLAG` const (no comment-only "kept in sync" duplication). 8 regression tests
  added across `aegis-language` and the parent client; `language_protocol` fuzz
  still panic-free (7.9M runs).

### Added

- Source-target router and catch-only script-file reader (ADR-022 §6, L1
  Iteration 4 slices 1-4): `src/analysis/router::route` resolves analyzable
  source in an intercepted command — explicit interpreter, versioned-basename
  normalization (`python3.11` → `python3`), trusted-alias program names,
  argv script-file arguments, direct execution of a path verified by shebang
  (`./script.py` with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`), quoted/expanding heredocs
  and here-strings (expansions/substitutions degrade rather than being
  evaluated), a narrowly-proven `printf '%s' <literal> | interpreter`
  pipeline, and a literal top-level `cd -- <path> &&` cwd rebase (any other
  `cd` form degrades a relative target instead of resolving against the
  wrong directory) — reusing `aegis-parser`'s production tokenizer and
  `Effective program` resolution throughout (so launcher-prefix stacking like
  `sudo timeout 5 python3 -c …` is handled once, not duplicated). An exact
  registry match always takes precedence over a conflicting alias entry.
  `src/analysis/source_reader::read_script_file` performs the actual bounded,
  catch-only file read: rejects symlinks/FIFOs/sockets/directories without
  following them, bounds reads to the configured limit without a full-file
  read on oversized files, strips a UTF-8 BOM, rejects invalid UTF-8, and
  records only a SHA-256 hash — never the source itself. `router::route` also
  reuses an in-memory heredoc body instead of routing a `ScriptFile` read when
  a command writes it to a file and immediately executes that same file
  (narrowly: `cat > PATH`/`tee PATH <<HEREDOC && <interpreter> PATH`, exactly
  one top-level `&&`, identical literal path — any other shape falls back to
  the existing routing above). A new `[language_analysis]` `aegis-config`
  section (`script_file_limit_bytes`, default 256 KiB, non-configurable 1 MiB
  hard ceiling at every layer; `trusted_aliases`, a Global-layer-only concept
  — project-layer entries are dropped entirely, never merged) closes the
  Iteration 4 config-wiring gap, with full ratchet/warning/validation/schema
  coverage. Closed the Iteration 4 REVIEW GATE: a new `fuzz/fuzz_targets/
  router.rs` fuzzes `router::route`/`verified_shebang_language` for
  panic-freedom (200k local runs, panic-free); two tests pin that `route()`
  performs zero filesystem access even for a target whose parent directories
  do not exist; and a race-oriented stress test proves
  `source_reader::read_script_file` stays panic/hang/corruption-free under
  concurrent atomic symlink/regular-file swaps (the underlying TOCTOU gap
  remains an accepted, documented residual risk per ADR-022 §6 — this test
  demonstrates robustness under it, not closure).

### Fixed

- Language-worker protocol/client hardening (ADR-022 §2, L1 Iteration 3
  re-review): the encoder is now fallible (`encode_request`/`encode_response`
  return `Result<Vec<u8>, EncodeError>`) so an oversized source is rejected as
  `EncodeError::Oversized` instead of `.expect()`-panicking (no `.expect()` in
  production); the 1 MiB source ceiling is now legal — `MAX_SOURCE_BYTES = 1
  MiB` and `MAX_FRAME_PAYLOAD = MAX_SOURCE_BYTES + 1` budget the 1-byte language
  tag, so a 1 MiB source round-trips instead of being rejected as oversized
  (off-by-one fixed); the parent client propagates the stdin `flush()` error
  instead of dropping it (`let _ = flush` → typed `WorkerError::Io`), so a flush
  failure no longer masquerades as a read `Timeout`; `Worker::analyze` closes
  stdin after sending and reaps the child, and a worker that responds fully then
  exits non-zero degrades the whole session as `WorkerError::NonZeroExit`
  (previously silently reported as success); the `--internal-language-worker`
  flag literal is now a single shared `aegis::analysis::INTERNAL_LANGUAGE_WORKER
  _FLAG` const (no comment-only "kept in sync" duplication). 8 regression tests
  added across `aegis-language` and the parent client; `language_protocol` fuzz
  still panic-free (7.9M runs).

### Added

- Language-worker protocol and bounded ephemeral worker (ADR-022 §2, L1
  Iteration 3): a pure, length-bounded, versioned request/response framing
  layer in `aegis-language::protocol` — magic `AELW`, version 1, `request_id`
  correlation, disjoint request/response kind tags, a 1 MiB payload ceiling
  (ADR-022 §7), and `Ok(None)` for incomplete frames vs `Err` for malformed
  (bad magic, unsupported version, oversized, invalid kind, invalid payload).
  The only `Request` variant is `Parse { language, source }`; the wire format
  encodes no way to ask the worker for a path read or subprocess (pinned by an
  exhaustive kind-tag test). 15 framing tests.
- The ephemeral worker dispatch loop (`aegis-language::worker::run`) reads
  request frames, parses the supplied bytes with the pinned Tree-sitter
  grammar, and writes one `Response::{Parsed,ParseFailed}` frame per request,
  serving a bounded sequence (≤ `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SESSION`) then force-exiting.
  It is parse-only — no filesystem, subprocess, daemon, or socket — and every
  stop reason is typed (`RunOutcome`). 8 in-process dispatch tests.
- An undocumented `--internal-language-worker` CLI mode: `aegis` re-execs
  itself into the worker, delegating immediately to `aegis-language::worker::run`
  over stdin/stdout before any clap parsing or Tokio runtime construction, so
  the worker process stays minimal. 5 integration tests spawn the real binary
  over pipes — clean round-trip, stdout writes only frame bytes (no noise),
  clean exit on stdin close, and non-zero exit on a malformed frame.
- The parent language-worker client (`aegis::analysis::worker_client`): spawns
  the worker, frames requests/responses, correlates responses by `request_id`
  in send order under a per-session deadline, and converts every worker
  failure (timeout, early close, protocol noise, duplicate response,
  out-of-order response, unexpected id, I/O error) into a typed `WorkerError`
  that maps to `DegradationReason::WorkerFailure`, retaining responses already
  received when a failure ends the session. Hybrid tests: real subprocess for
  clean round-trip / non-zero exit / stdout noise, `tokio::io::duplex` mocks
  for timeout / duplicate / out-of-order / unexpected / partial-prior-results.
  9 client tests. (Wiring into an `Assessment` is deferred to the Iteration 1
  monotonic merge + Iteration 4 source routing.)
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/language_protocol.rs`: fuzzes the protocol decoders on
  arbitrary bytes; both decoders are panic-free (return `Ok(None)` or `Err`),
  verified by a 7.8M-iteration smoke run (ADR-022 §2, L1 Iteration 3 REVIEW
  GATE).
- `aegis-language` is now a dependency of the root `aegis` binary; `analysis`
  added to the `src/lib.rs` public API surface (`ARCHITECTURE.md §8` updated).
- `aegis-language` crate skeleton with the release grammar manifest
  qualification contract: it rejects an unpinned grammar, missing license,
  Tree-sitter ABI outside the pinned runtime's compatible range, or a grammar
  absent from the L1 release set; the four foundation grammars (Python,
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell/Bash) are pinned via crates.io SemVer, statically
  linked, and parse-qualified on the host build against the live Tree-sitter
  runtime ABI; `docs/language-grammar-manifest.md` records provenance, versions,
  and licenses (ADR-022 §8/§9, L1 Iteration 0).
- Minimal parse-only language worker experiment and no-source contract: an
  in-process `aegis-language` router detects analyzable inline interpreter
  source (`python3 -c`, `bash`/`sh -c`, `node -e`) without filesystem access,
  and the parse-only worker does not start for no-source commands; a contract
  test plus a criterion benchmark harness assert `Outcome::NotStarted` for a
  no-source corpus, failing CI if a no-source command ever starts the worker
  (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0 RED #3).
- Architectural boundary tests for `aegis-language`: `tests/aegis_language_boundary.rs`
  pins both ADR-022 §4 directions in code — no workspace crate may depend on
  `aegis-language`, and `aegis-language` may not depend on any workspace crate
  (only the pinned Tree-sitter runtime, the four L1 grammars, and `thiserror`).
  Each direction was proven RED by injecting a forbidden dep, then reverted to
  GREEN (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0).
- Manifest pin and provenance contract tests: `builtin_manifest_versions_match_cargo_lock_pins`
  proves each grammar manifest version equals the exact `Cargo.lock` pin
  (closing the gap where `validate_entry` only rejects empty/`*` versions, not
  caret ranges — ADR-022 §8), and `builtin_manifest_provenance_is_complete`
  enforces that the plan-mandated inventory fields (crate_name, upstream,
  license, version) are populated so they are not inert. Each was proven RED by
  a temporary manifest break, then reverted to GREEN (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0).
- Parse-latency benchmark: `benches/parse_latency_bench.rs` measures per-grammar
  parse latency on one representative inline-source snippet per foundation
  grammar (ADR-022 Iteration 0 GREEN measurement), wired into the CI perf job.
- Language-aware analysis common Detection- rule + evidence data model in
  `aegis-types` (new `analysis` module): `DetectionMechanism`
  (`RegexPattern`/`TokenPrefixRule`/`LanguageRule`), `DetectionSource`,
  `OperandCertainty` (`Known`<`Partial`<`Dynamic`, ordered), `OperationKind`,
  `OperationModifiers`, `DetectedOperation`, `SourceOrigin`, `ByteSpan`,
  `AnalysisProvenance` (metadata only — no source body/snippet/AST/value, pinned
  by a serialization-boundary privacy test), `AnalysisStatus`
  (`NotApplicable`<`Complete`<`Degraded`, ordered), `DegradationReason` (the
  seven ADR-022 §4 buckets), `TargetAnalysis`, and `MatchEvidence` (type-state
  enum: variant encodes mechanism, `LanguageRule` always carries operation +
  provenance). Zero-I/O, no Tree-sitter, no parser-crate dependency (ADR-022 §4,
  L1 Iteration 1 RED #1).
- `Assessment::basis()` returns the new `AssessmentBasis` — every decisive Match
  at the Assessment's maximum `RiskLevel`, or `Fallback` only when no rule
  matched (ADR-022 §4). The legacy `Assessment::decision_source()` is retained
  unchanged for v1 compatibility projection (L1 Iteration 1 RED #2).
- Scanner compatibility fixtures (`crates/aegis-scanner/src/scanner/tests/
  compatibility.rs`): hand-verified golden corpus pinning the current
  `Assessment` contract (risk, key matched pattern ID, `DecisionSource`,
  `effect_opaque`) across Safe / Danger-regex / Warn-prefix / Block-regex /
  effect-opaque-Safe / inline-extracted-Danger cases, derived from the built-in
  pattern definitions as an independent source of truth — a guardrail for the
  later Pattern→Detection evidence refactor (ADR-022 §4, L1 Iteration 1 RED #4).
- Every scanner `Match` now carries typed `MatchEvidence` identifying its
  detection mechanism and source (ADR-022 §4, L1 Iteration 1 Slice D).
  `MatchResult.evidence` is populated by the scanner at construction —
  `RegexPattern` for regex `Pattern` and pipeline-semantic matches,
  `TokenPrefixRule` for `Token-prefix rule` matches — with a new
  `From<PatternSource> for DetectionSource` mapping the legacy per-pattern
  source onto the common per-Match source. The field is internal: it is not
  projected into the v1 JSON `matched_patterns` or audit `MatchedPattern`
  output, so classifications and public output are byte-for-byte unchanged
  (pinned by the Slice A compatibility fixtures + `full_pipeline_json`).
  `aegis-scanner` and the root `interceptor::scanner` re-export the analysis
  types (`MatchEvidence`, `DetectionMechanism`, `DetectionSource`,
  `AssessmentBasis`) so consumers reach them through the existing path.
- `ScanExplanation` (aegis-explanation) now carries `basis: AssessmentBasis`
  alongside the v1 `decision_source` projection (ADR-022 §4, L1 Iteration 1
  Slice F-narrow). Populated via `Assessment::basis()` in
  `build_explanation_from_plan` and the shell-flow explanation builder. The
  field is `#[serde(skip)]` with `Default for AssessmentBasis = Fallback`, so
  it is available in memory but NOT persisted into the v1 audit JSONL —
  existing audit entries deserialize byte-for-byte and the integrity chain is
  preserved; Iteration 2 (Audit v2) promotes it to a persisted, v2-compat
  field. The v1 `decision_source` string/label and JSON output are unchanged.
- Audit schema v2 optional fields on `aegis-audit`: `DecisionEntry` gains
  `basis: Option<AssessmentBasis>` and `analysis: Option<AnalysisSummary>`;
  `MatchedPattern` gains typed `evidence: Option<MatchEvidence>` and a stable
  `detection_id: Option<String>` (ADR-022 §10, L1 Iteration 2). All are
  `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`, so a legacy v1
  line (absent v2 fields) deserializes with them as `None` and serializes
  byte-for-byte identical to the pre-v2 form. Fresh runtime entries populate
  `basis` from `Assessment::basis()` and `analysis` from `Assessment::analysis`,
  and each matched pattern carries its `MatchResult.evidence` + a stable
  detection id derived from the evidence (`LanguageRule` → provenance rule id,
  falling back to the pattern id; regex/token-prefix → pattern id).
  `matched_patterns` and `pattern_ids` remain as v1 compatibility
  projections alongside the v2 fields. The integrity payload covers the v2
  fields (skip-if-none), so v1 hashes are unchanged and mixed v1/v2 logs verify
  without rewriting old lines or versioning `chain_alg`; tampering any v2 field
  breaks the chain. Pinned by `crates/aegis-audit/tests/audit_v2.rs` (v1/v2
  round-trip, mixed-log deserialize/query/rotation/integrity, source-privacy
  allowlist + denylist, and v1 projection compatibility).

### Changed

- `CONVENTION.md` §3 and §6, `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.9, and
  `docs/performance-baseline.md` updated to reflect `aegis-language`: 11→12 lib
  crates (13 workspace members), the `aegis-language` boundary asserted by
  tests, `tree-sitter 0.26.11` + the four L1 grammars added to the approved-dep
  list (scoped to `aegis-language` only, ADR-022 §8), and the Iteration 0
  no-source latency budget recorded (~103 ns/command) with peak-memory and
  binary-size budgets explicitly deferred to the iterations that wire the
  ephemeral worker and link the crate (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0).
- `docs/performance-baseline.md` Iteration-0 section rewritten to cover all six
  GREEN measurement bullets (clean-build requirements, binary growth = 0,
  parse latency measured, peak worker RSS deferred, startup cost deferred,
  all-target build parity exercised) and add a REVIEW GATE status table; the
  unverifiable "consistent with prior ~109 ns" comparison was dropped in favor
  of the measured number plus a reproducible bench command (ADR-022, L1
  Iteration 0).
- The `cross-matrix` CI job now compiles `--tests -p aegis-language` per target
  (not just the crate) so `grammar_smoke`, which references all four grammars,
  links on each of the four release targets — proving link-presence on all
  targets, with runtime parse-presence staying host-only (ADR-022 §8, L1
  Iteration 0 RED #2).
- Duplicated boundary-test helpers extracted to `tests/common/mod.rs`, shared
  by `tests/architecture_boundaries.rs` and `tests/aegis_language_boundary.rs`,
  removing the drift risk between the two `assert_no_dep` copies.
- `CONTEXT.md` gains a `## Language-aware analysis` glossary section for the
  terms now backed by implemented types (Detection rule, Detection mechanism,
  Detection source, Match evidence, Detected operation, Operand certainty,
  Analysis status, Analysis degradation, Degradation reason, Analysis
  provenance, Source origin, Target analysis, Assessment basis, Decisive
  Match), and the `Decision source` entry cross-references `Assessment basis`
  as its successor (ADR-022 §4, L1 Iteration 1 review-fix #1).
- `AssessmentBasis` derives `schemars::JsonSchema` (consistency with the other
  audit-persistable analysis types) and shares the `"kind"` serde discriminator
  tag with `MatchEvidence`, so the two new audit enums land with one
  convention; the domain terms live in the variant values and the
  `DetectionMechanism`/`mechanism()` projection (L1 Iteration 1 review-fix #2/#4).
- The Iteration 0 REVIEW GATE is honestly **open on one item**: `cargo audit`
  (no tree-sitter/criterion advisories), `cargo deny check`, and license review
  pass, and the four release builds are CI-gated, but the grammar security
  corpus is not yet built. It is required before `aegis-language` is linked
  into the shipping binary (not yet linked), so it is not a v0.6.x release
  blocker (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0).
- Accepted the design for the planned pre-1.0 Language-aware analysis milestone:
  an additive, isolated Tree-sitter stage with catch-only source inspection, typed
  degradation, four-language foundation qualification, and staged 1.x adapter
  rollout; no analyzer runtime is implemented yet (ADR-022, L1).

### Fixed

- `CONTEXT.md` no longer ahead of the implementation: it had added Iteration 1/9
  glossary terms (Detected operation, Operand certainty, Analysis provenance,
  Detection rule, Assessment basis, Language-aware rule, Analysis override, and
  related scaffolding) with no code under them, against the plan's "not a design
  scratchpad" rule. Reverted to the shipped vocabulary (`DecisionSource`,
  `MatchResult`); language-aware terms will enter the glossary in the iterations
  that implement them (ADR-022, L1 Iteration 0).

## [0.6.2] — 2026-07-16

### Security

- Optional Sandbox degradation is now visible and auditable on every execution surface: Shell warns on stderr, Watch emits protocol-safe warning or required-block diagnostics without blocking its Tokio worker, Audit records the prepared path including `NotAttempted`, `aegis-sandbox` remains locally packageable with its versioned foundation dependency, and `sandbox.required = true` remains fail closed; public docs define the write/network guardrail and preparation/exec error contracts without claiming confidentiality (ADR-021, M1).

### Fixed

- Audit initialization now tolerates another same-user process winning creation of an owner-only Audit directory while still rejecting symlinks, non-directories, wrong owners, and non-`0700` modes; the cross-platform Recovery PTY integration waits for the visible prompt and keeps BSD `script` input open until the child exits, preventing VEOF from overtaking its queued one-time response on macOS (ADR-016, ADR-020, H9).

### Changed

- Renamed the repository to `IliasAlmerekov/aegis-shellguard`: all repository URLs in the README, installer scripts, packaging metadata, tests, and docs now point at the new address (GitHub redirects the old ones). The product name **Aegis**, the `aegis` binary, crate names, npm package `@iliasalmerekov/aegis`, Homebrew tap `IliasAlmerekov/aegis`, config files, and `~/.aegis/` paths are unchanged.
- Release publication now pins the Node.js 24-native `actions/download-artifact` v8.0.1 and `softprops/action-gh-release` v3.0.2 by immutable SHA, removing the Node.js 20 deprecation annotation from future tag workflows.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-15

### Security

- H9 required recovery now survives missing Snapshot-plugin availability: bounded ADR-016 Effect-opaque execution denies without a TTY when no required Snapshot is created, offers only a visible one-time interactive Recovery override, records `no_snapshot_available` with the final Audit decision, and keeps ordinary non-opaque Danger Snapshots best-effort (ADR-016, H9).
- H7b audit hardening now creates Unix Audit directories/artifacts with owner-only modes, rejects unsafe final-component targets through descriptor-bound no-follow opens, preflights every managed rotation slot, and stages gzip archives before commit; non-Unix and parent-entry/durability limits remain explicit (ADR-020, H7b).
- H7a follow-up: SQLite Rollback now preserves the caller-owned live database mode, unsafe Snapshot-store metadata reads yield the typed permission rejection, and a stale Supabase manifest temp is bypassed with a fresh secure reservation (ADR-019, H7a).
- H7a snapshot artifacts now use owner-only Unix modes (`0700` directories and `0600` files); unsafe Snapshot store leaves are tightened or rejected before sensitive writes, while non-Unix behavior deliberately makes no POSIX-mode claim (ADR-019, H7a).
- H6 snapshot path containment: SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL now prove every rollback/delete artifact stays beneath the plugin-owned Snapshot store, rejecting traversal, outside, sibling-prefix, and symlink escapes; SQLite restores only to its configured live database path, never an identifier-provided destination (ADR-018, H6).
- H5 audit-integrity contract: `ChainSha256` is now consistently described as an unkeyed local audit integrity chain that detects corruption and inconsistent edits, not an adversarial anchor; `aegis audit --verify-integrity` states that bounded contract, and a tracked-file wording guard prevents capability overclaims (ADR-017, H5).
- Effect-opaque execution (`sh ./cleanup.sh`, `python3 ./x.py`, `source ./x`, `. ./x`, `sh -s`, and existing pipe-to-shell shapes) now requires a pre-execution recovery snapshot under `SnapshotPolicy::{Selective, Full}` when an applicable snapshot plugin exists — without raising `RiskLevel` or introducing a confirmation prompt; `SnapshotPolicy::None` remains the trusted/global opt-out and project `.aegis.toml` cannot disable the requirement under the C3 ratchet (ADR-016, H9).
- Shell hooks (`claude-code.sh`, `codex-pre-tool-use.sh`) now fail closed when the `aegis` binary is unavailable: a `command -v` guard before `exec` emits a `deny` decision (matching the Rust `hook_deny_output` shape) and exits 0 instead of letting `exec` fail with 127 and pass the command through unscanned (ADR-007, closes H4).
- Bumped transitive `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.18 → 0.9.20 to clear RUSTSEC-2026-0204 (invalid pointer dereference in the `fmt::Pointer` impl for `Atomic`/`Shared`); pulled in via the `starlark` chain (`blake3` → `rayon-core` → `crossbeam-deque`).

### Added

- Effect-opaque execution model and detection (ADR-016, H9): a direct `effect_opaque: bool` field on `Assessment` (orthogonal to `RiskLevel`), bounded v1 shape detection in the scanner (script-file execution, interpreter stdin, pipe-to-shell) with an allocation-free pre-filter that keeps the safe hot path under 2 ms, a `confinement_required` axis plumbed through `PolicyDecision` (false in v1, reserved for an optional strict tier), and a `RecoveryDegradation` enum for future missing-recovery reasons.
- Audit entries now record `effect_opaque`, `snapshots_required`, `confinement_required`, and `recovery_degradation` as backward-compatible optional fields (`#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`) so older JSONL entries still deserialize (ADR-016, H9).
- Landing: copy-to-clipboard confirmation (checkmark pop-in) on the install snippet button, a number-ticker count-up for the trust-strip stats, a sliding tab indicator with fade-in content on the "Why Aegis" tabs, a shake/pulse entrance and key-press feedback in the live demo terminal, and a hover state on trust-strip cards.
- Landing: `public/aegis.svg` replaces `shield-icon.png` as the nav and footer mark, re-exported with its square background frame removed (flood-filled to alpha transparency from the vectorized source) so only the shield-and-prompt glyph shows against any surrounding background.

### Fixed

- Effect-opaque audit + classifier (ADR-016, H9 review cycle): runtime audit construction now populates `effect_opaque` and `snapshots_required` from the assessment and policy decision instead of emitting the `Some(false)` defaults, so a `sh ./cleanup.sh` execution that policy required recovery for is no longer logged as if no backstop was needed; `confinement_required` records the v1 state (optional strict tier still reserved). Inline-flag detection is now position-sensitive — `python ./x.py -c` / `bash ./x.sh -c` stay effect-opaque (the script file is the payload, a later `-c`/`-e` is a script argument), while `python -c "code" ./x.py` stays inline — and a bounded per-interpreter table of value-consuming options (`--require`/`-r`/`--import`, `-m`/`-W`/`-X`, `-I`/`-C`) skips the option's separate-argument value when locating the first positional, so a path-like *option argument* (`./preload.js` in `node --require ./preload.js -e "code"`) no longer spoofs the script-file slot and a real inline body is no longer misclassified as effect-opaque; this is a v1 bounded heuristic (ADR-016) — unlisted value-consuming flags can still spoof the slot, accepted because the error direction is fail-safe (an extra recovery snapshot, never a block) whereas the inverted heuristic would drop a real script file's recovery snapshot. `Mode::Audit` is documented as an intentional, observe-only opt-out from ADR-016 recovery (broader than `SnapshotPolicy::None`).
- Landing: `NumberTicker` could latch onto a wrong value (e.g. showing `-5%` instead of `100%`) if the trust-strip's `IntersectionObserver` toggled `inView` during a fast scroll — the first `requestAnimationFrame` tick anchored elapsed time to a `performance.now()` call taken before the frame was scheduled, which could yield a negative delta, and the "already played" flag latched on start rather than completion so a cancelled mid-flight animation could never re-run to correct itself.

### Changed

- Locked the remaining H9 ADR-016 design: bounded Effect-opaque execution requires at least one Snapshot independently of plugin availability, non-interactive degradation denies, and interactive execution needs a non-persistable one-time Recovery override; ordinary non-opaque Danger snapshots remain best-effort (ADR-016, H9).
- Locked the H7b audit-artifact hardening design: Unix owner-only artifacts,
  target-level no-follow, tighten-if-owned migration, whole-rotation preflight,
  staged gzip commit, and explicit parent/non-Unix/durability limits; the
  implementation followed after the H7a clean-cycle fact refresh.
- Closed the M10 backlog finding after PR #120 merged with all required CI checks green; the README denial example and command-flow wording now match the verified snapshot ordering.
- Normalized the 1.0 security backlog: closed verified work, split H7/M3 into independently closable findings, narrowed H9 to the remaining ADR-016 contract, aligned H5/M1/M8 with the heuristic-guardrail product boundary, replaced stale sprints with dependency order, and moved implementation detail into linked `docs/plans/` files.
- CI: eliminated duplicate push+PR runs on feature branches (`push` trigger now scoped to `main` only) and added a `concurrency` group that cancels superseded runs on non-`main` refs only — pushes to `main` always run to completion so every commit gets a full audit/deny/fuzz pass, and the weekly schedule/`workflow_dispatch` can't race-cancel an in-flight `main` push (or vice versa).
- CI: split the `build` and `live-installer` jobs into always-on Linux jobs plus gated `build-macos`/`live-installer-macos` jobs that only run on pushes to `main`, PRs targeting `main`, the weekly schedule, and manual dispatch — cuts macOS runner minutes (billed at 10x Linux) on every feature-branch push/PR while keeping macOS coverage before merge to `main`. `release.yml` macOS builds are unaffected.
- CI: added `timeout-minutes` to the `quality`, `security`, `build`, `build-macos`, `live-installer`, and `live-installer-macos` jobs so a hung runner (macOS in particular) fails fast instead of burning minutes up to GitHub's 360-minute default.
- CI: pinned the macOS runners to `macos-26` instead of the drifting `macos-latest` label so the build/installer jobs target a fixed image.
- CI: dropped `--locked` from the `cargo-fuzz` install step so the fuzz job isn't broken by a stale lockfile for the tool.
- CI: deduped Rust toolchain setup into a composite action and gated the heavy jobs behind a single job to cut redundant work.

### Fixed

- Restored release docs required by the `release_docs` tests after a docs prune removed them.
- Docs: corrected `PROJECT_STATE.md` (crate list 9→11, test count, open-items sync), `CONVENTION.md` (10→11 crates, stale `src/audit/logger.rs` / `src/snapshot/` paths), `ROADMAP.md` (native-Windows items withdrawn per M4, crate count), and `ARCHITECTURE.md` (staleness banner) during the 2026-07-09 checkup; removed the snapshot line from the README Before/After denial example (M10).

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-03

### Security

- Extended FS-015 rsync delete coverage to include `--delete-missing-args` (turns missing-source-args errors into destination-side deletions).
- Narrowed DB-006 redis-cli rule to only fire when `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB` is the first non-option token (the Redis command), not when it appears as a key argument to another command (e.g. `redis-cli GET FLUSHALL`); implemented via a local `redis_cli_flush_is_command` predicate following the FS-011 pattern.

- Hardened H3-followups scanner coverage for missed destructive CLI forms:
  `wipefs` short flag bundles, `gcloud storage rm --recursive`, `rsync --delete*`,
  `blkdiscard`, `sgdisk --zap-all`/`-Z`, destructive `parted`, and
  `redis-cli FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`.
- Closed the C4 token-prefix anchoring bypass (ADR-014): token-prefix and by-program indexed detections now resolve an `Effective program` per scan target by stripping built-in launcher prefixes (`rtk`, `sudo`, `env`, `command`, `nice`, `timeout`, etc.) and basename-normalizing absolute program paths, so `/usr/bin/git reset --hard`, `rtk git clean -fd`, `sudo /bin/kill -9 1`, and `/usr/local/bin/docker volume prune` no longer bypass migrated Git/Cloud/Docker/Process rules. Timeout options (`-s`/`--signal`, `-k`/`--kill-after`, `--preserve-status`, etc.), sudo environment assignments, unknown sudo/env launcher flags, and stacked sudo options (`sudo -n -u postgres ...`) are handled conservatively so option arity drift prompts rather than silently missing.
- Audit hash-chain append no longer bricks command interception when the active audit log ends with a torn/truncated final line: tail scanning now walks back to the previous valid JSONL entry instead of failing closed on the malformed tail.
- Closed the C3-residual project-config weakening paths (ADR-013): a project-layer `[[rules]]` entry whose effective decision is `Allow` — either a top-level `decision = "allow"` or a `decision = "prompt"`/`"block"` rule with `when.then = "allow"` (resolved at runtime by `effective_decision`) — is now DROPPED at merge and surfaced as a `project_security_ratchet` warning by `aegis config validate`. Unlike an `[[allow]]` entry (capped by `allowlist_override_level`), a `[[rules]] Allow` auto-approves a `Warn`/`Danger` command before `Mode` with no ceiling, so a repository could otherwise silently auto-approve a `Danger` command. The project layer may still tighten via `Prompt`/`Block`; global `[[rules]]` stays last-wins. `audit.integrity_mode` is now ratcheted so a project cannot weaken `ChainSha256` to `Off` (stricter of base/requested wins, warned); global stays last-wins. The merge and warning paths share the same `is_untrusted_allow` predicate and `most_restrictive_integrity_mode` helper, so the reported `kept` value matches the effective merged value.

### Fixed

- Codex project configuration and agent prompts now reference `.codex/AGENTS.md` after moving the Codex instruction file out of the repository root.

### Security

- Project-local `.aegis.toml` can no longer weaken security-critical config fields inherited from defaults/global config; project attempts to set audit-only mode, broader allowlist overrides, weaker CI policy, disabled snapshots (`auto_snapshot_*` flags), or a weaker sandbox (`sandbox.enabled`/`required`/`allow_network`/`allow_write`) are ratcheted to the stricter value and reported by `aegis config validate`. `true`-is-stricter fields keep `base || requested`, `allow_network` keeps `base && requested`, and `allow_write` keeps the trusted base set under the project layer (ADR-013).
- Closed the C3 sibling-field snapshot bypass: a project layer can no longer empty/narrow a provider target config (`sqlite_snapshot_path`, `postgres_snapshot`/`mysql_snapshot`/`supabase_snapshot` `database`, `docker_scope`) to make an enabled provider a silent no-op. The ratchet is conditional on the provider being enabled in the trusted base (`snapshot_policy != None && (Full || auto_snapshot_<provider>)`), matching the registry materialization rule (under `None` nothing is materialized, so no ratchet fires); repointing to another non-empty target stays allowed. `docker_scope` ratchets structurally — a project may only keep-or-broaden (`All` broadest; `Labeled`↔`Labeled` same label = keep; `Names`→`Names` with overlay patterns ⊇ base patterns = broaden); intra-rank narrowing (disjoint `Names`, pattern subset, `Labeled`↔`Names` cross-mode, `Labeled` label change) is rejected and warned (ADR-013).
- `sandbox.allow_write` now honors project-side tightening: the project overlay is merged as the intersection with the trusted base (preserving base order), so a project may narrow the writable surface; expansion attempts (paths outside the base) are dropped and reported by `aegis config validate` (ADR-013). The warning gates on genuine expansion (a requested path absent from the base), so a reordered-but-equal subset no longer triggers a spurious advisory.
- `PartialSandboxSettings` and the direct `SandboxSettings` now set `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so misspelled sandbox fields (e.g. `require`, `allow_netork`) fail closed at parse time instead of leaving the intended security field silently unset.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-24

### Security

- Claude Code interception no longer depends on `aegis` being on the hook-exec PATH: `aegis install-hooks --claude-code` (and `--all`) now materializes an absolute, jq-free shim at `~/.claude/hooks/aegis-pre-tool-use.sh` and registers its absolute path in `settings.json`, at parity with the Codex hook (ADR-012).

### Fixed

- `aegis install-hooks --claude-code` now migrates away every aegis-managed legacy Bash registration — the bare `aegis hook` command and the legacy `aegis-rewrite.sh` file — to the absolute shim while preserving unrelated user hooks (including commands that merely mention `aegis`); reinstall is idempotent (ADR-012).
- The shared `aegis hook` deny response now emits a top-level `reason` mirroring `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason`, so the deny message is visible in both Claude Code (top-level `reason`) and Codex (`permissionDecisionReason`) (ADR-012).
- `scripts/uninstall.sh` now removes the absolute Claude hook shim and prunes its `PreToolUse` `Bash` registration, alongside the existing legacy `aegis hook` / `aegis-rewrite.sh` cleanup (ADR-012).
- `scripts/uninstall.sh` normalizes a trailing slash on `$HOME` before building prune paths so they match the absolute path the Rust installer registers via `std::path::absolute` / `Path::join` (which never emits a doubled separator); root `/` is preserved (ADR-012).
- `scripts/hooks/claude-code.sh` now ends with a trailing newline (POSIX text-file convention), and the ADR-012 "byte-identical except header" wording was corrected to "behaviorally identical; only agent-specific comments differ" since the two shims cross-reference each other by name (ADR-012).
- Closed the C2 `$IFS` command-obfuscation bypass by normalizing unquoted literal `$IFS` / `${IFS}` as shell separators during tokenization, so destructive forms such as `rm$IFS-rf$IFS/`, `rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}/`, and `dd${IFS}of=/dev/sda` classify correctly across direct, nested-shell, heredoc, and process-substitution paths; quoted, escaped, and non-IFS variable forms stay opaque.
- Restored fail-closed hook test coverage for non-object `tool_input` payloads and centralized production POSIX shell quoting for setup-shell/Codex hook generation (ADR-011).
- `aegis setup-shell` now accepts scoped npm install paths (e.g. `@iliasalmerekov/aegis`); paths are POSIX single-quote escaped in the managed rc block instead of rejected, and errors name whether the real shell path or the Aegis binary path was invalid (ADR-011).
- Codex `SessionStart` hook now emits guidance under `additionalContext` instead of the invalid `context` field, fixing `hook returned invalid session start JSON output` (ADR-011).

### Changed

- The Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook is now a jq-free shim that `exec`s the Rust `aegis hook` (byte-identical to the Codex shim except for its header), replacing the legacy jq-based `aegis-rewrite.sh` script; `install::mod` now shares `write_executable`, `resolved_aegis_bin`, and `combine_outcomes` between the Claude and Codex installers instead of duplicating them (ADR-012).
- Codex `PreToolUse` hook now transparently rewrites unwrapped Bash commands through `aegis --command` (`permissionDecision: "allow"` + `updatedInput`) by delegating to the Rust `aegis hook`, instead of denying and relying on the model to retry. This removes the `jq`/`python3` runtime dependency from the Codex hook (ADR-011).
- The Rust `aegis hook` rewrite now fails closed on commands that begin with the bare `aegis` word but are not a canonical `aegis --command '<...>'` wrapper, and passes canonical wrappers through untouched (ADR-011).
- Installed Codex pre-tool-use hook embeds a shell-quoted absolute Aegis binary path so it works under a minimal hook-exec PATH; an explicit `AEGIS_BIN` still overrides it (ADR-011).

### Added

- npm postinstall best-effort agent hook setup: runs `aegis install-hooks --all` when `~/.claude` or `~/.codex` already exists, prints next steps otherwise, never creates agent directories, and never fails the npm install (opt out with `AEGIS_NPM_SKIP_HOOKS=1`) (ADR-011).

### Changed

- Simplified `README.md` to a minimal public contract (What / Why / Install / How it works) with a visible threat-model link and an honest heuristic-not-a-sandbox statement (M6 docs gate).
- Aligned landing page copy with the current install flow while keeping the existing design (3D shield and section layout unchanged): installer/Homebrew/npm/Cargo, `aegis setup-shell` opt-in, `v0.5.8`, and honest audit wording (append-only; tamper-evident when hash-chain integrity is enabled) replacing the prior overclaim (M6).
- Prepare release metadata for v0.5.8 after the v0.5.7 release build hit the stale `ldd` static-link verification path (M3.2).

### Removed

- Non-production landing source artifacts not used by the runtime: `landing/pencil.pen`, `landing/DESIGN.md`, `landing/tokens.json`, and unused image assets (`landing/images/Hitem3d-1781772057946.glb`, `landing/images/generated-1781681175337.png`) (M6).
- `test_q` stray compiled ELF binary from the repo root (M6).

### Added

- `aegis setup-shell` — explicit opt-in command for shell hook installation (ADR-009)
- Supply-chain gates: `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` both green in CI (M5.4)
- npm wrapper package with native binary download per platform (M3.4)
- npm checksum updater script for release automation
- GitHub Releases CI: static musl targets for Linux (M3.2)
- Homebrew formula/tap with formula updater (M3.3)
- GitHub Releases with `.sha256` sidecars (M3.5)
- Fuzz corpus CI job at ≥ 100 000 iterations per target (M5.2)
- Snapshot/rollback integration tests in CI (M5.3)

### Fixed

- Fixed C1 uppercase scanner bypass by compiling built-in regex patterns case-insensitively while preserving custom regex case sensitivity.
- Render the README hero GIF through standard Markdown image syntax so GitHub treats it like other animated demos (M6 docs gate).
- Ignore `/test_q` at the repo root so the stray compiled ELF cannot be re-committed (M6).
- Release CI: verify static Linux binaries via `readelf` (ELF headers) instead of `ldd`; fixes false failures on musl `static-pie` (x86_64) and cross-compiled `aarch64` binaries (M3.2)
- `setup-shell`: block symlink recursion and rc injection
- Gate starlark-policy dependency — closed supply-chain lint warnings
- Follow GitHub release redirects in npm installer
- Keep npm package contents minimal

### Security

- `setup-shell` rejects symlink loops and prevents injection into shell rc files

---

## v0.5.6

### Highlights

- **Sandbox bypass is an audit event** (ROADMAP 6.4): every executed command
  now records a `sandbox_status` field in the audit log — `active` (a sandbox
  profile was applied), `unavailable` (a configured sandbox could not be applied
  and the command ran unconfined — a bypass), or `not_configured`. When a bypass
  occurs, Aegis also emits a `WARN` on the `aegis::sandbox` target. Setting
  `sandbox.required = true` still turns unavailability into a hard block.

### Documentation and contracts

- Audit log entries gain the canonical `sandbox_status` field. The legacy
  `sandbox_active` boolean is still written (mirrored from the status) and read,
  so existing log readers and older logs remain compatible.

---

## v0.5.3

### Highlights

- **Binary-first hook installation**: the documented release-install flow now
  describes Claude Code / Codex hook setup as running through the installed
  `aegis` binary when supported agent directories are already present, instead
  of depending on a local repository checkout.
- **Honest skip behavior**: current docs now state that automatic hook setup
  only updates agent directories that already exist and skips missing
  `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` directories without seeding them.
- **Single follow-up command**: README, troubleshooting, and release docs now
  point users at `aegis install-hooks --all` as the supported explicit rerun
  command after agent directories appear later.

### Documentation and contracts

- `README.md` now documents automatic hook setup as a binary-first flow and
  replaces local-checkout-only follow-up guidance with `aegis install-hooks --all`.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` now explains the skip reason in terms of missing
  agent directories and tells users to rerun `aegis install-hooks --all`.
- `docs/releases/current-line.md` and `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` now describe
  the binary-first auto-attempt path, skip semantics, and explicit follow-up
  command honestly.

---

## v0.5.1

### Highlights

- **Keyword scanner regression test hardening**: the `keywords.rs` source-slice
  helper used by the hot-path regression test now stops at the actual `mod
tests` boundary instead of relying on a naive split. This keeps literal
  `chars.next().unwrap()` strings inside test-only helpers from causing false
  positives against production-code assertions.
- **Release metadata bumped to 0.5.1**: `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` now track
  the `0.5.1` crate version for the current release line.
- **Tracker cleanup**: repository-local `REVIEW.md` and `TODO.md` were removed
  from the release tree so the tagged state reflects the current curated docs
  set more closely.

### Documentation and contracts

- `CHANGELOG.md` now tracks the `v0.5.1` release line.
- `docs/releases/current-line.md` now tracks the `0.5.1` release line.
- `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` now references `0.5.1` as the current pre-1.0
  crate version when describing the future `v1.0.0` target.
- The release documentation continues to describe Aegis as a heuristic shell
  guardrail rather than a sandbox or hard security boundary.

---

## v0.5.0

### Highlights

- **Managed agent-hook install flow**: the current release line now documents
  and ships the local-checkout-only installation path for Claude Code and Codex
  hook payloads, including their shared toggle helper behavior.
- **Global toggle + CI posture clarified**: the `aegis on`, `aegis off`, and
  `aegis status` flow remains part of the public current line, with docs and
  tests aligned around the default-on CI enforcement contract and explicit
  `AEGIS_CI` override semantics.
- **Installer and hook hardening**: deprecated installer controls stay rejected,
  uninstall cleanup removes installed hook payloads and registrations together,
  and hook fallback paths remain best-effort without silently weakening the main
  guardrail contract.
- **Release and architecture docs refreshed**: architecture, install,
  troubleshooting, and release-readiness docs were updated to describe the
  global-first installer and current release workflow honestly.

### Documentation and contracts

- `docs/releases/current-line.md` now tracks the `0.5.0` release line.
- `docs/releases/v1.0.0.md` now references `0.5.0` as the current pre-1.0
  crate version when describing the future `v1.0.0` target.
- The release documentation continues to describe Aegis as a heuristic shell
  guardrail rather than a sandbox or hard security boundary.

---

## v0.4.0

### Highlights

- **Global-first installer flow**: the convenience installer no longer prompts
  for Global / Local / Binary setup modes. It validates shell support up front,
  performs the managed global shell setup path, and prints explicit follow-up
  guidance.
- **Dynamic on/off toggle**: Aegis now exposes `aegis on`, `aegis off`, and
  `aegis status` backed by the global `~/.aegis/disabled` flag.
- **Zero-noise disabled mode**: outside CI, disabled shell-wrapper and
  supported hook usage behave as though Aegis were absent for ordinary command
  flow while still preserving the explicit toggle history.
- **CI override contract**: detected CI environments keep enforcement active by
  default, while `AEGIS_CI` can explicitly override CI detection in either
  direction.
- **Shared hook toggle helper**: Claude Code and Codex hook installations now
  share the managed helper path `~/.aegis/lib/toggle-state.sh`, with fail-safe
  fallback behavior if that helper is missing.
- **Honest install / uninstall behavior**: local hook setup is auto-attempted
  only from a real local checkout, and uninstall now removes both installed
  hook payloads and their JSON registrations.

### Documentation and contracts

- `README.md` now documents the global-first installer, the removed
  `AEGIS_SETUP_MODE` / `AEGIS_SKIP_SHELL_SETUP` controls, and the verified
  disabled / CI-override behavior.
- Added `docs/architecture-decisions.md` to capture the current architecture,
  documented non-goals, toggle / CI decisions, and fuzzing guidance referenced
  by contributor and security docs.
- Troubleshooting and release docs now describe the current installer and hook
  setup behavior instead of the removed interactive setup-mode flow.

---

## v0.3.0

### Highlights

- **Interactive installer with three setup modes**: the install script now asks
  the user to choose Global, Local (project-only), or Binary-only setup.
- **Local mode**: creates `.aegis/enter.sh` in the project directory and
  immediately launches a protected shell — no manual activation needed.
- **ASCII banner**: the installer displays an Aegis banner on startup.
- **Simplified README**: rewritten for clarity with a "Why Aegis exists" section
  explaining the motivation (vibe coders, full-permission agents, accidental
  data loss). Installation is now a single command with an interactive prompt.
- **`AEGIS_SETUP_MODE` env var**: allows CI and scripts to select the setup mode
  non-interactively (`global`, `local`, or `binary`).
- **Supabase snapshot provider**: Aegis can now snapshot and rollback Supabase
  databases before dangerous commands, alongside existing Git, Docker, MySQL,
  and PostgreSQL providers.

### Internal

- Updated contract tests to match the new README structure.
- Fixed duplicate `#[test]` attribute in installer tests.
- Added three new installer integration tests covering all setup modes.

---
