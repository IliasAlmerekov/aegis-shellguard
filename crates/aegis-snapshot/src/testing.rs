//! Test hooks for observing snapshot registry materialization.
//!
//! Exposed so that upstream crates can observe how many times the registry
//! was materialised in a single test thread — without introducing a hard
//! dependency on the internal implementation. Compiled only for this crate's
//! tests and behind the `testing` feature, which dependents enable from
//! `[dev-dependencies]` alone.
