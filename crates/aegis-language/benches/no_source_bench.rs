//! Iteration 0 RED #3 — benchmark harness for the no-source contract.
//!
//! A no-source command must not start the language worker (ADR-022; plan
//! Iteration 0 RED #3). This criterion harness measures the no-source path of
//! [`aegis_language::worker::analyze`] over a corpus of no-source commands and
//! asserts each one yields [`Outcome::NotStarted`]. If a regression ever makes
//! a no-source command start the worker, the assertion panics inside the
//! iteration body, the bench exits non-zero, and the CI perf job fails.
//!
//! The contract is also pinned by a fast `#[test]` in `tests/no_source.rs`
//! (runs in `cargo test --workspace` on every PR); this harness additionally
//! keeps the no-source path on the performance-regression wall so a slow path
//! that quietly grew filesystem metadata calls is caught before main.
//!
//! Since Iteration 10 the recorded mean is also gated by the
//! `no_source_does_not_start_worker` row in `perf/scanner_bench_baseline.toml`.
//! One iteration walks the *whole* corpus, so adding `NO_SOURCE` entries raises
//! the mean with no real regression — rebaseline that row in the same change.
//! See `docs/performance-baseline.md`.
