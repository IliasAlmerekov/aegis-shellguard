//! Language-aware analysis data model (ADR-022 §4).
//!
//! This module holds the **zero-I/O shared types** that let the scanner model
//! represent all detection mechanisms — regex `Pattern`, `Token-prefix rule`,
//! and Language-aware rule — through one common contract, plus the typed
//! evidence, status, and degradation vocabulary that language adapters emit.
//!
//! Constraints (plan Iteration 1 REVIEW GATE):
//! - Pure data only. No filesystem access, no subprocess, no Tree-sitter
//!   types, and no dependency arrow from this crate to any parser crate.
//! - These types carry no source body, full snippet, variable value, or AST.
//!   Provenance persists metadata only (ADR-022 §10).
//!
//! Behavior is unchanged by introducing this module: the existing scanner
//! `Assessment` and `MatchResult` are not yet refactored onto this model (that
//! is a later slice). The types here are the foundation language-aware
//! analysis will populate.
