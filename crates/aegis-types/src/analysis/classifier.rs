//! Shared language-aware operation classifier (ADR-022 §3, plan Iteration 5).
//!
//! This is the single place that maps a [`DetectedOperation`] — emitted by any
//! language adapter — into the existing Aegis `Category` / `RiskLevel` /
//! `Match` vocabulary. No adapter assigns a final `RiskLevel` directly or keeps
//! a private copy of this semantics (Iteration 5 REVIEW GATE); every adapter
//! routes through [`classify`].
//!
//! Invariants pinned by `classifier_tests`:
//! - The risk mapping is **certainty-independent**. A `Dynamic` operand never
//!   lowers risk below a `Known` one (ADR-022 §3/§7); certainty governs
//!   recursive enqueueing and degradation, which are the queue's concern.
//! - [`classify`] never returns [`RiskLevel::Block`]. Language-aware Matches are
//!   non-`Block` by ADR-022 §5; `Block` is reserved for intrinsic shell-level
//!   denials and remains unbypassable.
//! - [`OperationKind`] is matched exhaustively so adding a variant forces a
//!   classification here rather than silently falling through.
