# ADR-013: Project config uses a security ratchet

## Status

Accepted. Annotated 2026-08-20 — see [Annotation](#annotation--2026-08-20-two-ratcheted-fields-leave-the-set).

## Context

Aegis loads built-in defaults, then global user config, then project-local
`.aegis.toml`. The project layer is untrusted input when an AI agent enters a
repository. Pure last-layer-wins semantics allowed a repository to set
`mode = "Audit"`, `allowlist_override_level = "Danger"`, and
`snapshot_policy = "None"`, weakening Aegis to audit-only behavior for
non-`Block` commands. An initial ratchet covered only a few scalar fields, but
sibling fields stayed last-wins: a project could disable `sandbox.enabled`, set
`auto_snapshot_* = false`, enable `sandbox.allow_network`, or expand
`sandbox.allow_write`, each silently defeating a stricter global base.

## Decision

Project-local config may only tighten security-critical fields, never loosen
them. The ratcheted set is: `mode`, `allowlist_override_level`, `ci_policy`,
`snapshot_policy`, `sandbox.enabled`, `sandbox.required`,
`sandbox.allow_network`, `sandbox.allow_write`, the `auto_snapshot_*` flags
(`git`, `docker`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `supabase`, `sqlite`), the provider
target config (`sqlite_snapshot_path`, `postgres_snapshot`/`mysql_snapshot`/
`supabase_snapshot` `database`, `docker_scope`), `audit.integrity_mode`, and
project-layer `[[rules]]` `decision = "Allow"`. Global config remains the
user's trusted policy layer. When a project config attempts to weaken one of
these fields, Aegis keeps the more restrictive value and
`aegis config validate` reports a warning.

Directionality is field-specific. For booleans where `true` is the stricter
value (`sandbox.enabled`, `sandbox.required`, all `auto_snapshot_*`), the
Project layer keeps `base || requested` (the stricter of base/requested wins).
For `sandbox.allow_network`, where `true` is the weaker value (it grants
network access), the Project layer keeps `base && requested`. For
`sandbox.allow_write` (a `Vec<PathBuf>` where more entries is weaker), the
Project layer keeps the trusted base set and ignores the project value
entirely. Global always stays last-layer-wins for every field.

`auto_snapshot_*` and `sandbox.enabled` close the bypass where a project could
otherwise disable snapshots or the sandbox despite a stricter `snapshot_policy`
or `sandbox.required` inherited from defaults or global config.

## Consequences

Repository-local config can still add patterns, scoped `[[allow]]`/`[[block]]`
rules (capped by `allowlist_override_level`), and tighter project policy. It
can no longer silently disable prompts, snapshots, CI blocking, the sandbox
itself, required sandbox behavior, or audit integrity inherited from defaults
or global config. Users who intentionally want a weaker posture (e.g. opting
out of git snapshots, granting network access, or disabling the audit
integrity chain) must set it in their global config rather than letting a
repository impose it. The merge path and the warning collector share the same
ratchet helpers, so the reported `kept` value always matches the effective
merged value.

Two ratchets deserve explicit call-out, because each closes a bypass with the
same shape as the original C3 attack — a repository silently auto-approving or
de-safeguarding a `Warn`/`Danger` command:

- **Project-layer `[[rules]]` `decision = "Allow"`** is dropped (and warned),
  not honored. A `[[rules]]` `Allow` auto-approves a command *before* `Mode`
  and with *no* `allowlist_override_level` ceiling (unlike an `[[allow]]`
  entry, which is capped). Without this ratchet, a repository could add a
  `[[rules]]` entry matching e.g. `git reset --hard` with `decision = "Allow"`
  and auto-approve a `Danger` command with no prompt, defeating the ratchet on
  `allowlist_override_level`. Project `[[rules]]` may still tighten
  (`Prompt`/`Block`); only `Allow` is untrusted. A project that needs an
  auto-approve must declare the rule in global config.
- **`audit.integrity_mode`** is ratcheted so a project cannot weaken it to
  `Off`. (The chain is an integrity/corruption check, not adversarial
  tamper-evidence — see TASKS.md H5 — but silently disabling even that from an
  untrusted repo is the same weakening shape and is closed here.)

## Annotation — 2026-08-20: two ratcheted fields leave the set

Decided in [#240](https://github.com/IliasAlmerekov/aegis-shellguard/issues/240),
recorded as an amendment to
[ADR-029](adr-029-the-sandbox-is-a-mandatory-1-0-layer.md). The ratchet stands;
what changes is which fields it covers and how one of them merges.

- **`sandbox.enabled` and `sandbox.required` are no longer ratcheted fields.**
  Both leave the 1.0 configuration contract entirely: they are accepted by exact
  name, ignored at any value, and warned about with `deprecated_sandbox_field`.
  There is nothing left for a project layer to weaken, because there is no
  effective flag. The bypass this ADR closed is closed more strongly than a
  ratchet could: the Sandbox is a mandatory layer, so it applies whatever any
  layer says. The Decision text above that names them — the ratcheted set, the
  `base || requested` directionality, and the "`auto_snapshot_*` and
  `sandbox.enabled` close the bypass" paragraph — is superseded for those two
  fields only; every other field in the set is untouched.
- **`sandbox.allow_write` becomes a semantic tree intersection.** "The Project
  layer keeps the trusted base set and ignores the project value entirely" is
  replaced by a component-wise intersection of path trees, computed at merge with
  no filesystem access. A project layer may therefore narrow the ceiling, which
  the old rule made impossible. An attempted widening still keeps the base and
  still emits `project_security_ratchet` — the project asked for more than it
  received, so the warning is owed. A malformed individual entry gets its own
  outcome, `trusted_ceiling_path_omitted`, rather than being reported as a
  merge-time weakening.
- **The Consequences paragraph is narrowed.** "It can no longer silently disable
  … the sandbox itself, required sandbox behavior" now describes the mandatory
  layer rather than this ratchet. The remaining list — prompts, snapshots, CI
  blocking, audit integrity — is unchanged.

`PRD.md` §5.5 is the normative statement of the resulting `[sandbox]` semantics.
