# Aegis troubleshooting and recovery

This page covers common operational failures and practical recovery steps.

## Installer: quick failure lookup

### `unsupported operating system: Windows`

**Why:** Aegis shell proxy is implemented for Unix-style shells only.

**Fix:**

1. Run inside WSL2 Linux terminal (not native PowerShell/cmd).
2. Confirm `README.md` platform policy and support matrix.

### `checksum verification failed`

**Why:** The downloaded `.sha256` artifact is missing, malformed, or does not match the binary.

**Fix:**

1. Rerun install with stable network access and re-check URL.
2. Confirm the release asset names match your OS/ARCH (`aegis-linux-x86_64`, `aegis-macos-aarch64`, etc.).
3. Verify downloaded files are not changed by intermediaries (proxy/caching/CDN layer).
4. Ensure binary and checksum assets are in sync before retrying.

### `checksum download failed`

**Why:** `curl`/`wget` or checksum download URL is unavailable.

**Fix:**

1. Retry when network is stable.
2. Verify GitHub release assets exist for the selected tag.
3. If this is a temporary registry/CDN issue, try again after a short interval.

### `no supported checksum tool found`

**Why:** Host has neither `sha256sum` nor `shasum`.

**Fix:**

1. Install one of them (`sha256sum` preferred).
2. Re-run install once tool is available.

### Manual checksum verification fails

**Why:** The downloaded release asset and `.sha256` sidecar do not match, or
one of the files was changed in transit.

**Fix:**

1. Re-download both files from the same release tag.
2. Make sure you are checking the checksum file for the exact asset name.
3. Verify with one of the supported commands:
   - `sha256sum -c <asset-name>.sha256`
   - `shasum -a 256 -c <asset-name>.sha256`
4. Do not install the binary until the checksum check passes.

### Cannot write binary / rc file during install

**Why:** Insufficient permissions for `BINDIR` or shell RC path.

**Fix:**

1. Use a writable prefix (`AEGIS_BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin`).
2. Ensure `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` writable.
3. Re-run with `AEGIS_REAL_SHELL` and `AEGIS_SHELL_RC` explicitly set when shell detection is wrong.

### `AEGIS_SETUP_MODE and AEGIS_SKIP_SHELL_SETUP are deprecated`

**Why:** The convenience installer no longer supports the old mode-selection
switches. It now performs the global shell-setup path only.

**Fix:**

1. Remove `AEGIS_SETUP_MODE` and `AEGIS_SKIP_SHELL_SETUP` from your install command or environment.
2. If you only want the binary, use the verification-first manual install path from `docs/release-readiness.md`.
3. If you need a custom shell RC file, rerun with `AEGIS_SHELL_RC=/path/to/your/rcfile`.

### `automatic shell setup supports bash and zsh`

**Why:** The convenience installer only knows how to pick an RC file
automatically for `bash` and `zsh`.

**Fix:**

1. Re-run with `AEGIS_SHELL_RC=/path/to/your/rcfile`.
2. If shell detection is wrong because you are already inside an Aegis-managed shell, also set `AEGIS_REAL_SHELL=/path/to/your-real-shell`.
3. If you only want the binary on `PATH`, use the manual install path in `docs/release-readiness.md`.

### `Agent hook setup skipped; no supported agent directories were detected.`

**Why:** The installer checked your `HOME` for supported agent directories
before attempting automatic hook setup, and it did not find a detectable
`~/.claude` or `~/.codex` directory. Aegis skips hook installation when an
agent directory does not exist yet.

**Fix:**

1. Start Claude Code or Codex once so its config directory exists.
2. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --all`.
3. If your current shell does not see `aegis` on `PATH` yet, use the absolute
   path printed by the installer, such as `$HOME/.local/bin/aegis install-hooks --all`.
4. If you only want to verify the installed binary path, run `command -v aegis`.

### Wrapper recursion errors

**Error:** `refusing to wrap ... recursively`

**Why:** `SHELL` already points to Aegis-managed wrapper and real shell is not explicitly provided.

**Fix:**

1. Export the real shell explicitly: `export AEGIS_REAL_SHELL=$(command -v bash)` (or `zsh`).
2. Re-run installer with `AEGIS_REAL_SHELL` set.

## Build: quick failure lookup

### `failed to compile bubblewrap for Linux target: libcap not available via pkg-config`

**Why:** Building the workspace on Linux requires the `libcap` headers: the
`aegis-sandbox` build script compiles the vendored bubblewrap C sources and
pkg-config-probes `libcap` (ADR-029 §3–§4). A host with only the runtime
`libcap.so.2` (no `libcap-dev`, no `libcap.pc`) fails here by design — a
missing capability library must not produce a silently weaker `bwrap`.

**Fix:**

1. Install the headers: `sudo apt-get install -y libcap-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu), or your distribution's equivalent.
2. If you cannot install them, `AEGIS_SKIP_BWRAP_BUILD=1` skips the C build — but the resulting binary has no embedded `bwrap` fallback, so confinement then requires a usable system `bwrap` on `PATH`. Never use this in CI.
3. To build against an alternative bubblewrap checkout instead of the vendored tree, set `AEGIS_BWRAP_SOURCE_DIR=<path>`.

## Agent hooks (Claude Code / Codex)

### `error: real shell path contains unsafe characters` after npm install

**Why:** Older Aegis versions validated `setup-shell` paths with a strict
allow-list that rejected the `@` in a scoped npm install path
(`.../node_modules/@iliasalmerekov/aegis/vendor/aegis`). The error always blamed
the "real shell path" even when the Aegis binary path was the offender.

**Fix:**

1. Upgrade Aegis: current versions single-quote escape the path instead of
   rejecting it, and name whether the real shell path or the Aegis binary path
   was invalid.
2. If you cannot upgrade, pass an explicit binary path without `@`, e.g.
   `aegis setup-shell --aegis-bin "$(command -v aegis)"` after symlinking the
   binary to a plain path.

### Codex: `hook returned invalid session start JSON output`

**Why:** Older Codex `SessionStart` hooks emitted guidance under `context`;
Codex expects `additionalContext`.

**Fix:**

1. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --codex` (or `--all`) to refresh the hook scripts.
2. Confirm `~/.codex/hooks/aegis-session-start.sh` emits
   `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.

### Hook scripts are not fail-closed on a panic or crash

The fail-closed `Hook` layer (ADR-023) lives in the installed per-agent `Hook`
scripts. If you installed Aegis before this protection shipped, your installed
scripts still `exec` the binary and would go silent if it crashed. Refresh them
to the current content:

1. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --all` (or `--claude-code` / `--codex`).
2. The installer rewrites any managed hook whose content differs from the
   current template; it reports `hook installed` when it did.

Managed hooks are updated explicitly; they never self-update while a session
starts. A stale script is the one failure mode the outer layer cannot cover, so
refreshing after an upgrade is the documented way to gain the protection.

### Aegis says it is disabled when an agent session starts

**Why:** `aegis off` is an explicit operator control. The local Toggle is
effective outside CI, so commands use unguarded passthrough until it is
re-enabled.

**Fix:**

1. Run `aegis status` to inspect the configured and effective state.
2. Run `aegis on` to re-enable enforcement.
3. If the session does not show the current effective-state notice after an
   Aegis upgrade, re-run `aegis install-hooks --all`. Managed hooks are updated
   explicitly; they never self-update while a session starts.

### Hooks installed but commands are not intercepted

**Why:** Codex requires hooks to be enabled and trusted. The registration can be
present in `~/.codex/hooks.json` while the feature is disabled or the hook is
untrusted.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm `~/.codex/config.toml` has `[features] hooks = true`.
2. Review and trust hooks inside Codex with `/hooks`.
3. For Claude Code, confirm `~/.claude/settings.json` has a `PreToolUse` `Bash`
   hook whose `command` is the absolute shim path
   `~/.claude/hooks/aegis-pre-tool-use.sh` (not the bare `aegis hook`).
4. Verify the rewrite end to end:
   `printf '{"tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | aegis hook` should print a
   `permissionDecision: "allow"` response whose `updatedInput.command` is
   `aegis --command 'git status'`.

### Claude hook not firing / not on PATH

**Why:** Older installs registered the bare `aegis hook` command, which only
works when `aegis` is on the PATH Claude Code uses to execute hooks. Current
installs register an absolute, PATH-independent shim path and migrate the
legacy registration away.

**Fix:**

1. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --claude-code` (or `--all`) to materialize the
   shim at `~/.claude/hooks/aegis-pre-tool-use.sh` and register its absolute
   path.
2. Confirm `~/.claude/settings.json` `PreToolUse` `Bash` hook `command` is the
   absolute shim path, not `aegis hook`.
3. Re-run after any Aegis upgrade so the shim's embedded `__AEGIS_BIN__` is
   refreshed to the current binary path.

### Legacy `aegis-rewrite.sh` still present

**Why:** The original Claude hook (jq-based, `aegis-hook-version: 1`) installed
to `~/.claude/hooks/aegis-rewrite.sh`. The current installer no longer writes it
and migrates its registration to the new shim, but a stale file or registration
can remain from an older install.

**Fix:**

1. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --claude-code`; the installer prunes the legacy
   `aegis hook` and `aegis-rewrite.sh` registrations and registers the new shim.
2. To clean up entirely, run `aegis-uninstall` (or `scripts/uninstall.sh`),
   which removes `aegis-rewrite.sh`, the new shim, and both registrations, then
   reinstall.

### Project-local Claude hook not removed by uninstall

**Why:** `scripts/uninstall.sh` prunes only the global `~/.claude/settings.json`
and `~/.claude/hooks/` paths. A project-local install (`aegis install-hooks
--claude-code --local`, writing `<project>/.claude/`) is out of uninstall's
scope by design.

**Fix:**

1. In the project, remove `<project>/.claude/hooks/aegis-pre-tool-use.sh` and
   the `PreToolUse` `Bash` entry pointing at it from
   `<project>/.claude/settings.json`.
2. Or re-run `aegis install-hooks --claude-code --local` to refresh the local
   shim if you want to keep it.

### Older Codex hook fails with missing `jq` or `python3`

**Why:** Earlier Codex hook scripts shelled out to `jq`/`python3` to parse and
deny commands.

**Fix:**

1. Re-run `aegis install-hooks --codex` to install the current shim, which
   delegates parsing and the transparent rewrite to the `aegis` binary and needs
   neither `jq` nor `python3`.

## Audit integrity verification

### `aegis audit --verify-integrity` fails

**Why:** The integrity chain was never enabled, a rotated segment is missing,
or the log files were altered.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm `[audit] integrity_mode = "ChainSha256"` was enabled before the log
   entries you want to verify were written.
2. Make sure the active audit file and any rotated archives are present.
3. Re-run `aegis audit --verify-integrity` against the full log set.
4. Treat the failure as a sign that the log should not be trusted until you
   inspect the files.

## Uninstall recovery

If wrapper state becomes inconsistent:

- `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IliasAlmerekov/aegis-shellguard/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh`
- Check `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` cleanup: only Aegis-managed block should be removed.
- Confirm binary removal: `command -v aegis` no longer points to managed path.

Then reinstall cleanly.

## Rollback / snapshot failures

`aegis rollback` is strict and may fail by design when invariants are not met.

### Common messages and next steps

- `snapshot not found`
- malformed snapshot ID
- `rollback conflict` or stash-related conflict path
- manifest/config mismatch

For these cases:

1. Check audit trail for a clear snapshot id:
   `aegis audit --risk Danger --format json`.
2. Do not rerun destructive commands blindly after rollback denial.
3. In conflict cases, inspect repository state (`git status`, open files, git logs) before manual recovery.
