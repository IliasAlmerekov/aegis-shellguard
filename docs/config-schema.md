# Config schema

## Schema evolution

Aegis config uses an explicit `config_version` field.

This section is the repository's explicit `schema evolution` and `migration` reference.

- `config_version = 1` is the current schema.
- omitted `config_version` is treated as a legacy pre-version config input
- unsupported future versions are rejected explicitly

This document describes the current runtime contract for schema version `1`.

## Layered merge order

Effective config is merged in this order:

1. built-in defaults
2. global config: `~/.config/aegis/config.toml`
3. project config: `.aegis.toml`

Merge behavior:

- scalar fields: later layers override earlier layers
- vector fields such as `custom_patterns` and `allowlist`: layers are concatenated
- for merged vectors, global entries come first and project entries come after
- for allowlist precedence at runtime, project rules are checked before global rules

## Current schema version

```toml
config_version = 1
```

Current defaults:

```toml
config_version = 1
mode = "Protect"
allowlist_override_level = "Warn"
snapshot_policy = "Selective"
auto_snapshot_git = true
auto_snapshot_docker = false
auto_snapshot_postgres = false
auto_snapshot_mysql = false
auto_snapshot_sqlite = false
auto_snapshot_supabase = false
sqlite_snapshot_path = ""
ci_policy = "Block"
```

## Mode semantics

Current runtime modes are `Protect`, `Audit`, and `Strict`.

This `mode semantics` section documents the current runtime behavior.

### Protect

- `Safe` auto-approves
- `Warn` prompts unless an allowlist override makes it effective
- `Danger` prompts unless an allowlist override makes it effective
- `Block` always blocks
- bounded `Effect-opaque execution` uses Required recovery independently of its
  `RiskLevel`

### Audit

- `Safe`, `Warn`, `Danger`, and `Block` all remain non-blocking at runtime
- Audit mode does not prompt
- Audit mode does not request snapshots
- Audit mode is an intentional observe-only opt-out from Required recovery

### Strict

- `Safe` auto-approves
- `Warn` and `Danger` block unless an allowlist override makes them effective
- `Block` always blocks
- allowlist and policy-rule approval cannot waive effect-opaque Required recovery

### Prompt semantics

- interactive approval accepts only `y` / `yes`
- `Y` and `YES` are accepted after lowercase normalization
- empty input denies
- any other input denies
- read failure denies
- non-interactive prompt-required flows deny
- default is deny
- a Recovery degradation has a separate focused prompt with only
  `Run once without recovery` and `Deny`; it never offers a persistent rule

## Allowlist semantics

Allowlist rules use the structured array-of-tables form:

```toml
[[allow]]
pattern = "terraform destroy -target=module.test.*"
cwd = "/srv/infra"
user = "ci"
expires_at = "2030-01-01T00:00:00Z"
reason = "ephemeral test teardown"
```

Runtime rules:

- every runtime-effective allowlist rule must declare `cwd or user scope`
- every runtime-effective allowlist rule must declare `cwd` or `user` scope
- `pattern` and `reason` must not be empty
- if present, `cwd` and `user` must not be empty
- expired rules are invalid for runtime use
- patterns are matched against the trimmed command string
- `*` and `?` behave as glob wildcards
- exact rules match only the same command
- scoped rules match only when the current `cwd` and/or `user` also match
- project allowlist rules beat global allowlist rules when both match
- within the same layer, the first declared matching rule wins

Legacy compatibility:

- legacy examples may still appear as `allowlist = ["..."]` during migration discussions
- legacy string-array allowlists remain parseable for migration and inspection
- legacy string-array entries are normalized internally to structured rules with reason `migrated from legacy allowlist entry`
- legacy entries are `readable for migration, invalid for runtime` until they gain `cwd` and/or `user` scope

`allowlist_override_level` controls when allowlist matches change policy outcomes in `Protect` and `Strict`:

- `Warn`: allowlisted `Warn` commands may auto-approve
- `Danger`: allowlisted `Warn` and `Danger` commands may auto-approve
- `Never`: non-safe allowlist auto-approval is disabled
- `Block` never bypasses in `Protect` or `Strict`

## Snapshot policy

Snapshot planning has two distinct contracts:

- ordinary non-effect-opaque `Danger` commands use best-effort Snapshots when an
  applicable plugin is available
- bounded `Effect-opaque execution` in Protect or Strict uses **Required
  recovery** under `Selective` / `Full`: at least one Snapshot must be created
  before execution

- `None` never requests snapshots and is the trusted global recovery opt-out
- `Selective` honors `auto_snapshot_git` / `auto_snapshot_docker`
- `Selective` also honors `auto_snapshot_postgres` / `auto_snapshot_mysql` / `auto_snapshot_sqlite` / `auto_snapshot_supabase`
- `Full` requests all applicable snapshot plugins regardless of per-plugin flags

Important details:

- snapshots are attempted only after the ordinary command decision is approved
  or auto-approved, never for `Block` or a denied ordinary prompt
- snapshots are created before the command is executed; when a sandbox is configured, the snapshot happens before sandbox confinement is applied
- if there is no applicable Snapshot plugin, ordinary non-effect-opaque
  `Danger` behavior remains best-effort, but effect-opaque Required recovery
  remains active and becomes a Recovery degradation
- when no required Snapshot is created, non-interactive execution denies;
  interactive execution explains the missing recovery and offers only
  `Run once without recovery` or `Deny`
- `Mode::Audit` and `SnapshotPolicy::None` are intentional opt-outs and do not
  produce a Recovery degradation
- `Warn` requests no ordinary Danger Snapshot, but can still require recovery
  when the same command is effect-opaque
- blocked commands write an audit entry with an empty `snapshots` array
- denied commands write an audit entry with an empty `snapshots` array

Example:

```toml
snapshot_policy = "Selective"
auto_snapshot_git = true
auto_snapshot_docker = false

[docker_scope]
mode = "Labeled"
label = "aegis.snapshot"
name_patterns = []
```

## Database snapshot options

The per-plugin enable booleans are only honored when `snapshot_policy = "Selective"`.
The connection and path settings are still consumed by the snapshot providers in
`Selective` and `Full` mode, so keep them accurate whenever those providers may run.

### PostgreSQL snapshots

```toml
auto_snapshot_postgres = false

[postgres_snapshot]
database = ""
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = ""
```

- `auto_snapshot_postgres` enables PostgreSQL when a command's Snapshot plan requests it
- `postgres_snapshot.database` is required when PostgreSQL snapshots are enabled
- `postgres_snapshot.host` and `postgres_snapshot.port` select the database endpoint
- `postgres_snapshot.user` may be left empty to use `PGUSER` or the current OS user
- credentials must come from `PGPASSWORD` or `~/.pgpass`; never store passwords in config

### MySQL/MariaDB snapshots

```toml
auto_snapshot_mysql = false

[mysql_snapshot]
database = ""
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
user = ""
```

- `auto_snapshot_mysql` enables MySQL/MariaDB when a command's Snapshot plan requests it
- `mysql_snapshot.database` is required when MySQL/MariaDB snapshots are enabled
- `mysql_snapshot.host` and `mysql_snapshot.port` select the database endpoint
- `mysql_snapshot.user` may be left empty to use `MYSQL_USER` or `~/.my.cnf`
- credentials must come from `MYSQL_PWD` or `~/.my.cnf`; never store passwords in config

### SQLite snapshots

```toml
auto_snapshot_sqlite = false
sqlite_snapshot_path = ""
```

- `auto_snapshot_sqlite` enables SQLite when a command's Snapshot plan requests it
- `sqlite_snapshot_path` must point to the `.db` file, either relative to the current working directory or absolute
- SQLite snapshots do not use a username/password block; the database file path is the only required setting

### Supabase snapshots

```toml
auto_snapshot_supabase = false

[supabase_snapshot]
project_ref = ""
require_config_target_match_on_rollback = true

[supabase_snapshot.db]
database = ""
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = ""
```

- `auto_snapshot_supabase` enables the project-level Supabase provider when a command's Snapshot plan requests it, but the provider only applies when `supabase_snapshot.db.database` is set and both `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` are available
- in Phase 1, the effective captured scope is a **db-only manifest snapshot**
- `project_ref` is advisory-only metadata stored in the snapshot manifest for future audit/UI use
- `require_config_target_match_on_rollback` fail-closes rollback if current config disagrees with the manifest target
- `supabase_snapshot.db` configures the direct PostgreSQL transport used by Phase 1
- credentials must come from `PGPASSWORD` or `~/.pgpass`; never store passwords in config

## Sandbox

Effect-level confinement applied before a command executes (bwrap + Landlock on
Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS). It is a write/network guardrail and
not a confidentiality boundary, and not a privilege boundary. It complements the
string classifier, which matches how a command is *spelled* rather than what it
*does*.

This section documents **two states**, because they differ today: the 1.0 contract
that `PRD.md` §5.5 promises, and what the shipped 0.6.x binary does. Where they
disagree, the PRD is the promise and the code is the behaviour; the gap closes with
[#229](https://github.com/IliasAlmerekov/aegis-shellguard/issues/229) and
[#230](https://github.com/IliasAlmerekov/aegis-shellguard/issues/230).

### Current pre-1.0 implementation (0.6.x)

```toml
[sandbox]
enabled = false
required = false
allow_network = false
allow_write = []
```

- `sandbox.enabled` turns the sandbox layer on. Default `false`.
- `sandbox.required` — when `true`, a command is blocked if the sandbox cannot be
  applied (missing `bwrap`, unsupported kernel, etc.) instead of degrading to an
  unconfined run. Default `false`: infrastructure unavailability records
  `sandbox_status = "unavailable"`, emits a warning on the active Shell stderr or
  Watch NDJSON channel, and then preserves the approved decision. Invalid
  profiles and unexpected setup errors remain fail-closed.
  Set `sandbox.required = true` when unconfined fallback is unacceptable.
- `sandbox.allow_write` lists paths the sandboxed process may write to. Default
  empty (no writes outside the sandbox's own scope).
- `sandbox.allow_network` permits network access from the sandboxed process.
  Default `false`.
- Project-layer ratchet (ADR-013): `enabled` / `required` may only tighten (a
  project can force them on, never off); `allow_network` can only be turned off
  at the project layer, never on; and project `allow_write` is intersected with
  the base list — a project `.aegis.toml` can never widen the sandbox.
- These fields also appear in `aegis-schema.json` under `SandboxSettings`.

### The 1.0 contract (ADR-029 and its 2026-08-20 amendment, ADR-030)

- **The layer is mandatory.** Confinement is attempted for every executed command
  outside `Mode::Audit`; when it cannot be established the command is blocked, and
  the recorded `sandbox_status = "unavailable"` accompanies `Decision::Blocked` as
  one event. There is no unconfined continuation to configure.
- **`enabled` and `required` leave the contract.** Both are still accepted by
  **exact name** and **ignored at any value**, each producing a typed
  `deprecated_sandbox_field` diagnostic, for the whole support life of config
  schema v1. `enabled = false` is not fail-open: the layer applies regardless.
  Aegis **never rewrites a config file** to remove them.
- **Both leave the ADR-013 ratcheted set** along with the contract — there is
  nothing left to tighten once neither field affects behaviour.
- **`allow_write` becomes an explicit override** of a computed `Trusted ceiling`
  default rather than an addition to an empty base. A "full set" is unexpressible
  because the workspace is resolved at runtime, so the default applies only when
  the field is **absent**. An explicit `allow_write = []` is valid and means
  zero configured writable roots — not an error, and it gets **no fallback**: a
  fallback would be the one place Aegis grants authority the config never asked
  for.
- **Project tightening is a semantic tree intersection**, component-wise at merge
  and canonical at enforcement, applied to **both** the trusted ceiling and the
  effective roots. `..` is never folded lexically — `/workspace/link/../secret`
  with `link -> /etc/subdir` does not resolve to `/workspace/secret`.
- **A bad ceiling entry narrows instead of failing the load**, with its own typed
  outcome `trusted_ceiling_path_omitted` and reason
  `relative` / `parent_dir` / `not_found` / `outside_trusted_ceiling`. This is
  deliberately **not** a `Confinement degradation`: that term means the profile
  widened to the ceiling, this one means it narrowed. It does not promise "never
  blocks" — a TOCTOU between canonicalisation and `bwrap --bind` remains.
- **`allow_network` keeps its meaning** and stays project-tightenable to `false`
  only.
- Warnings for all of the above are typed diagnostics surfaced by
  `aegis config validate` and `aegis status`, never a per-`$SHELL -c` log line.
  Audit records the effective profile, not the causal diagnostics of how it was
  built.
- macOS permits `file-read*` in the generated Seatbelt profile; it restricts
  writes and network access but does not hide readable files or secrets. On
  Linux, bwrap exposes read-only system mounts plus explicitly bound writable
  paths. Narrowing all read access is outside the 1.0 product contract.
- Audit distinguishes `active`, `unavailable`, `not_configured`, and
  `not_attempted`. `not_configured` means Sandbox was disabled;
  `not_attempted` means it was enabled but no confined or fallback command was
  prepared because execution stopped earlier or setup failed closed.

## Language-aware analysis

Budgets and trusted aliases consumed by the Language-aware analysis source
router (ADR-022 §6). This section does not enable or disable the feature
itself — there is deliberately no `language_analysis.enabled` toggle; the
built-in Language-aware rules cannot be disabled or lowered by any config
layer.

```toml
[language_analysis]
inline_source_limit_bytes = 16384
script_file_limit_bytes = 262144
max_script_files = 8
max_depth = 8
max_targets = 16
max_aggregate_bytes = 1048576
timeout_ms = 100

[[language_analysis.trusted_aliases]]
alias = "py"
canonical = "python3"
```

- `inline_source_limit_bytes` bounds one inline interpreter body. Default and
  non-configurable hard ceiling: 16384 bytes (16 KiB).
- `script_file_limit_bytes` bounds how many bytes are read from a routed
  script file. Default 262144 (256 KiB). Bounded by a non-configurable 1 MiB
  hard ceiling at every layer (`LANGUAGE_ANALYSIS_SCRIPT_FILE_HARD_CEILING_BYTES`).
  Project-layer ratchet: may only lower it, never raise it above the trusted
  global value.
- `max_script_files` bounds top-level script-file reads (default/ceiling 8).
- `max_depth` bounds recursive language-target depth (default/ceiling 8).
- `max_targets` bounds all distinct top-level and recursive targets
  (default/ceiling 16).
- `max_aggregate_bytes` bounds all accepted source held during one session
  (default/ceiling 1048576 bytes / 1 MiB).
- `timeout_ms` bounds the complete session, including source resolution,
  worker request I/O, response processing, and child reaping
  (default/ceiling 100 ms).
- Trusted global config may tune these budgets within their hard ceilings;
  project config may only tighten the effective values.
- `trusted_aliases` maps a wrapper program name (e.g. a `py` shim) to the
  canonical registry interpreter it stands in for (e.g. `python3`). This is a
  Global-layer-only concept ("trusted global aliases only", ADR-022 §6): a
  project `.aegis.toml` can never add a new trusted interpreter alias —
  project-layer entries are dropped entirely rather than merged.
- These fields also appear in `aegis-schema.json` under `LanguageAnalysisConfig`.

## CI policy

`ci_policy` is a runtime policy input, not the GitHub Actions workflow definition.

Supported values:

- `Block`
- `Allow`

Current runtime behavior:

- in `Protect`, `ci_policy = Block` blocks non-safe commands instead of prompting
- in `Protect`, `ci_policy = Allow` does not short-circuit the normal policy flow
- with `ci_policy = Allow`, non-safe commands still follow the usual prompt path, so non-interactive confirmation surfaces can still deny
- `Strict` is not weakened by CI
- `Audit` remains non-blocking
- `Block` risk remains blocked regardless of CI policy

## Audit integrity mode

The runtime default is `ChainSha256`:

```toml
[audit]
integrity_mode = "ChainSha256"
```

Choose `Off` only when an operator intentionally opts out of integrity checks:

```toml
[audit]
rotation_enabled = true
integrity_mode = "Off"
```

Guidance:

- `Off` disables integrity chaining.
- `ChainSha256` links audit entries and rotated segments to detect corruption
  and inconsistent edits; it is not a keyed or remote anchor.
- verify the active and rotated logs with `aegis audit --verify-integrity`.

## JSON output contract

`aegis --output json` currently emits schema version `1`.

Top-level fields:

- `schema_version`
- `command`
- `risk`
- `decision`
- `exit_code`
- `mode`
- `ci_state`
- `matched_patterns`
- `allowlist_match`
- `snapshots_created`
- `snapshot_plan`
- `execution`
- optional `block_reason`
- `decision_source`

Current decision labels:

- `auto_approve`
- `prompt`
- `block`

Current execution contract:

- `execution.mode` is `evaluation_only`
- `execution.will_execute` is `false`

Example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "command": "rm -rf /tmp",
  "risk": "danger",
  "decision": "prompt",
  "exit_code": 2,
  "mode": "protect",
  "ci_state": { "detected": false, "policy": "block" },
  "matched_patterns": [],
  "allowlist_match": { "matched": false, "effective": false },
  "snapshots_created": [],
  "snapshot_plan": { "requested": true, "applicable_plugins": [] },
  "execution": { "mode": "evaluation_only", "will_execute": false },
  "decision_source": "builtin_pattern"
}
```

Notes:

- `matched_patterns[*]` includes pattern metadata, matched text, and optional `safe_alternative`
- `allowlist_match.pattern` and `allowlist_match.reason` are optional
- `block_reason` is optional and uses values such as `intrinsic_risk_block`, `strict_policy`, and `protect_ci_policy`
- `decision_source` is one of `builtin_pattern`, `custom_pattern`, or `fallback`

## Exit-code compatibility contract

Exit codes are part of the public contract and should not change without a
release compatibility decision.

Current mapping:

- `0` — command approved/executed successfully or `aegis` command completed successfully
- `2` — user denied in a prompt path (`prompt` decision)
- `3` — hard block (`block` decision)
- `4` — internal/config error (`aegis` error state, validation failure, runtime/setup failure)
- `1..=255` (except 2, 3, 4) — propagated exit code from the wrapped command

These values are also reflected in JSON output:

- `exit_code` in `--output json` always matches the process-level exit for the same run.
- for non-blocking prompt/deny outcomes the JSON exit code matches `2` (prompt) and `3` (block).

## Compatibility policy

- new releases should preserve compatibility for schema version `1`
- known legacy configs may be normalized into the current structured form
- unsupported future schema versions are rejected explicitly
- docs must follow current runtime behavior instead of guessing future semantics

## Deprecated fields

There are no active deprecated fields in schema version `1`.

If future config changes deprecate fields, the migration story must explain:

- what changed
- what replaces it
- whether old inputs are auto-migrated or rejected
- which schema evolution boundary introduced the deprecation
