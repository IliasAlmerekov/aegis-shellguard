//! Parent-side client for the ephemeral language worker (ADR-022 §2, L1
//! Iteration 3 slice 4).
//!
//! The parent process owns async orchestration. It spawns the worker as a
//! short-lived subprocess (`aegis --internal-language-worker`), writes
//! length-bounded request frames to the worker's stdin, reads response frames
//! from its stdout, correlates each response to its request by `request_id`
//! in send order, and enforces a per-session deadline. Every worker failure —
//! a timeout, an early close, a malformed frame on stdout, a duplicate or
//! out-of-order response, or an I/O error — is reported as a typed
//! [`WorkerError`] that maps to [`aegis_types::DegradationReason::WorkerFailure`].
//!
//! Responses already received when a failure ends the session are retained;
//! the remaining targets carry the failure (ADR-022 §2: "Results already
//! produced by the shell Scanner or an earlier analysis target are retained").
//!
//! This module is the pure client. Wiring its results into an `Assessment`
//! (monotonic merge with the baseline and prior target results) lands with the
//! Iteration 1 merge function and Iteration 4 source routing.
