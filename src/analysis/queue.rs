//! Parent-owned recursive analysis work queue (ADR-022 §7, plan Iteration 5
//! Slice 2).
//!
//! The parent owns recursive routing (ADR-022 §2). When an adapter detects a
//! literal process/eval payload, that payload becomes a new analysis target;
//! this queue is the bounded, deduplicated work queue those nested targets
//! enter. Targets are deduplicated by `(language, source_hash)` so a cycle or
//! a repeated target is analyzed once. Depth, target count, aggregate bytes,
//! and the session deadline are capped; exceeding any cap records
//! [`DegradationReason::LimitExceeded`] (ADR-022 §4) while preserving the
//! Matches already produced (ADR-022 §7).
//!
//! The queue is a pure in-memory control structure: it holds source bytes only
//! up to the aggregate-byte ceiling (≤ 1 MiB by default) and performs no I/O,
//! no worker spawn, and no filesystem access.
